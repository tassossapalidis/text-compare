SOMEONE LIKE YOU
Taste
THERE were six of us to dinner that night at Mike Schofield's house in London:
Mike and his wife and daughter, and my wife and I, and a man called Richard Pratt.
Richard Pratt was a famous gourmet. He was president of a small society
known as the Epicures, and each month he circulated privately to its members a
pamphlet on food and wines. He organized dinners where sumptuous dishes and rare
wines were served. He refused to smoke for fear of harming his palate, and when
discussing a wine, he had a curious, rather droll habit of referring to it as
though it were a living being. 'A prudent wine,' he would say, 'rather diffident
and evasive, but quite prudent.' Or, 'A good-humoured wine, benevolent and
cheerful slightly obscene, perhaps, but none the less good-humoured.'
I had been to dinner at Mike's twice before when Richard Pratt was there,
and on each occasion Mike and his wife had gone out of their way to produce a
special meal for the famous gourmet. And this one, clearly, was to be no
exception. The moment we entered the dining-room, I could see that the table was
laid for a feast. The tall candles, the yellow roses, the quantity of shining
silver, the three wineglasses to each person, and above all, the faint scent of
roasting meat from the kitchen brought the first warm oozings of saliva to my
mouth.
As we sat down, I remembered that on both Richard Pratt's previous visits
Mike had played a little betting game with him over the claret, challenging him to
name its breed and its vintage. Pratt had replied that that should not be too
difficult provided it was one of the great years. Mike had then bet him a case of
the wine in question that he could not do it. Pratt had accepted, and had won both
times. Tonight I felt sure that the little game would be played over again, for
Mike was quite willing to lose the bet in order to prove that his wine was good
enough to be recognized, and Pratt, for his part, seemed to take a grave,
restrained pleasure in displaying his knowledge.
The meal began with a plate of whitebait, fried very crisp in butter, and to
go with it there was a Moselle. Mike got up and poured the wine himself, and when
he sat down again, I could see that he was watching Richard Pratt. He had set the
bottle in front of me so that I could read the label. It said, 'Geierslay
Ohligsberg, 1945'. He leaned over and whispered to me that Geierslay was a tiny
village in the Moselle, almost unknown outside Germany. He said that this wine we
were drinking was something unusual, that the output of the vineyard was so small
that it was almost impossible for a stranger to get any of it. He had visited
Geierslay personally the previous summer in order to obtain the few bottles that
they had finally allowed him to have.
"I doubt whether anyone else in the country has any of it at the moment," he
said. I saw him glance again at Richard Pratt. "Great thing about Moselle," he
continued, raising his voice, "it's the perfect wine to serve before a claret. A
lot of people serve a Rhine wine instead, but that's because they don't know any
better. A Rhine wine will kill a delicate claret, you know that? It's barbaric to
serve a Rhine before a claret. But a Moselle--ah!--a Moselle is exactly right."
Mike Schofield was an amiable, middle-aged man, but he was a stockbroker. To
be precise, he was a jobber in the stock market, and like a number of his kind, he
seemed to be somewhat embarrassed, almost ashamed to find that he had made so much
money with so slight a talent. In his heart he knew that he was not really much
more than a bookmaker--an unctuous, infinitely respectable, secretly unscrupulous
bookmaker--and he knew that his friends knew it, too. So he was seeking now to
become a man of culture, to cultivate a literary and aesthetic taste, to collect
paintings, music, books, and all the rest of it. His little sermon about Rhine
wine and Moselle was a part of this thing, this culture that he sought.
"A charming little wine, don't you think?" he said. He was still watching
Richard Pratt. I could see him give a rapid furtive glance down the table each
time he dropped his head to take a mouthful of whitebait. I could almost feel him
waiting for the moment when Pratt would take his first sip, and look up from his
glass with a smile of pleasure, of astonishment, perhaps even of wonder, and then
there would be a discussion and Mike would tell him about the village of
Geierslay.
But Richard Pratt did not taste his wine. He was completely engrossed in
conversation with Mike's eighteen-year-old daughter, Louise. He was half turned
towards her, smiling at her, telling her, so far as I could gather, some story
about a chef in a Paris restaurant. As he spoke, he leaned closer and closer to
her, seeming in his eagerness almost to impinge upon her, and the poor girl leaned
as far as she could away from him nodding politely, rather desperately, and
looking not at his face but at the topmost button of his dinner jacket.
We finished our fish, and the maid came round removing the plates. When she
came to Pratt, she saw that he had not yet touched his food, so she hesitated, and
Pratt noticed her. He waved her away, broke off his conversation, and quickly
began to eat, popping the little crisp brown fish quickly into his mouth with
rapid jabbing movements of his fork. Then, when he had finished, he reached for
his glass, and in two short swallows he tipped the wine down his throat and turned
immediately to resume his conversation with Louise Schofield.
Mike saw it all. I was conscious of him sitting there, very still,
containing himself, looking at his guest. His round jovial face seemed to loosen
slightly and to sag, but he contained himself and was still and said nothing.
Soon the maid came forward with the second course. This was a large roast
beef. She placed it on the table in front of Mike who stood up and carved it,
cutting the slices very thin, laying them gently on the plates for the maid to
take around. When he had served everyone, including himself, he put down the
carving knife and leaned forward with both hands on the edge of the table.
"Now," he said, speaking to all of us but looking at Richard Pratt. "Now for
the claret. I must go and fetch the claret, if you'll excuse me."
"You go and fetch it, Mike?" I said. "Where is it?"
"In my study, with the cork out--breathing."
"Why the study?"
"Acquiring room temperature, of course. It's been there twenty-four hours."
"But why the study?"
"It's the best place in the house. Richard helped me choose it last time he
was here."
At the sound of his name, Pratt looked round.
"That's right, isn't it?" Mike said.
"Yes," Pratt answered, nodding gravely. "That's right."
"On top of the green filing cabinet in my study," Mike said. "That's the
place we chose. A good draught-free spot in a room with an even temperature.
Excuse me now, will you, while I fetch it."
The thought of another wine to play with had restored his humour, and he
hurried out of the door, to return a minute later more slowly, walking softly,
holding in both hands a wine basket in which a dark bottle lay. The label was out
of sight, facing downwards. "Now!" he cried as he came towards the table. "What
about this one, Richard? You'll never name this one!"
Richard Pratt turned slowly and looked up at Mike, then his eyes travelled
down to the bottle nestling in its small wicker basket, and he raised his
eyebrows; a slight supercilious arching of the brows, and with it a pushing
outward of the wet lower lip, suddenly imperious and ugly.
"You'll never get it," Mike said. "Not in a hundred years."
"A claret?" Richard Pratt asked, condescending.
"Of course."
"I assume, then, that it's from one of the smaller vineyards?"
"Maybe it is, Richard. And then again, maybe it isn't."
"But it's a good year? One of the great years?"
"Yes, I guarantee that."
"Then it shouldn't be too difficult," Richard Pratt said, drawling his
words, looking exceedingly bored. Except that, to me, there was something strange
about his drawling and his boredom: between the eyes a shadow of something evil,
and in his bearing an intentness that gave me a faint sense of uneasiness as I
watched him.
"This one is really rather difficult," Mike said. "I won't force you to bet
on this one."
"Indeed. And why not?" Again the slow arching of the brows, the cool, intent
look.
"Because it's difficult."
"That's not very complimentary to me, you know."
"My dear man," Mike said, "I'll bet you with pleasure, if that's what you
wish."
"It shouldn't be too hard to name it."
"You mean you want to bet?"
"I'm perfectly willing to bet," Richard Pratt said.
"All right, then, we'll have the usual. A case of the wine itself."
"You don't think I'll be able to name it, do you?"
"As a matter of fact, and with all due respect, I don't," Mike said. He was
making some effort to remain polite, but Pratt was not bothering overmuch to
conceal his contempt for the whole proceeding. And yet, curiously, his next
question seemed to betray a certain interest.
"You like to increase the bet?"
"No, Richard. A case is plenty."
"Would you like to bet fifty cases?"
"That would be silly."
Mike stood very still behind his chair at the head of the table, carefully
holding the bottle in its ridiculous wicker basket. There was a trace of whiteness
around his nostrils now, and his mouth was shut very tight.
Pratt was lolling back in his chair, looking up at him, the eyebrows raised,
the eyes half closed, a little smile touching the corners of his lips. And again I
saw, or thought I saw, something distinctly disturbing about the man's face, that
shadow of intentness between the eyes, and in the eyes themselves, right in their
centres where it was black, a small slow spark of shrewdness, hiding.
"So you don't want to increase the bet?"
"As far as I'm concerned, old man, I don't give a damn," Mike said. "I'll
bet you anything you like."
The three women and I sat quietly, watching the two men. Mike's wife was
becoming annoyed; her mouth had gone sour and I felt that at any moment she was
going to interrupt. Our roast beef lay before us on our plates, slowly steaming.
"So you'll bet me anything I like?"
"That's what I told you. I'll bet you anything you damn well please, if you
want to make an issue out of it."
"Even ten thousand pounds?"
"Certainly I will, if that's the way you want it." Mike was more confident
now. He knew quite well that he could call any sum Pratt cared to mention.
"So you say I can name the bet?" Pratt asked again.
"That's what I said."
There was a pause while Pratt looked slowly around the table, first at me,
then at the three women, each in turn. He appeared to be reminding us that we were
witness to the offer.
"Mike!" Mrs Schofield said. "Mike, why don't we stop this nonsense and eat
our food. It's getting cold."
"But it isn't nonsense," Pratt told her evenly. "We're making a little bet."
I noticed the maid standing in the background holding a dish of vegetables,
wondering whether to come forward with them or not.
"All right then," Pratt said. "I'll tell you what I want you to bet."
"Come on, then," Mike said, rather reckless. "I don't give a damn what it
is--you're on."
Pratt nodded, and again the little smile moved the corners of his lips, and
then, quite slowly, looking at Mike all the time, he said, "I want you to bet me
the hand of your daughter in marriage."
Louise Schofield gave a jump. "Hey!" she cried. "No! That's not funny! Look
here, Daddy, that's not funny at all."
"No, dear," her mother said. "They're only joking."
"I'm not joking," Richard Pratt said.
"It's ridiculous," Mike said. He was off balance again now.
"You said you'd bet anything I liked."
"I meant money."
"You didn't say money."
"That's what I meant."
"Then it's a pity you didn't say it. But anyway, if you wish to go back on
your offer, that's quite all right with me."
"It's not a question of going back on my offer, old man. It's a no-bet any
way, because you can't match the stake. You yourself don't happen to have a
daughter to put up against mine in case you lose. And if you had, I wouldn't want
to marry her."
"I'm glad of that, dear," his wife said.
"I'll put up anything you like," Pratt announced. "My house, for example.
How about my house?"
"Which one?" Mike asked, joking now.
"The country one."
"Why not the other one as well?"
"All right then, if you wish it. Both my houses."
At that point I saw Mike pause. He took a step forward and placed the bottle
in its basket gently down on the table. He moved the saltcellar to one side, then
the pepper, and then he picked up his knife, studied the blade thoughtfully for a
moment, and put it down again. His daughter, too, had seen him pause.
"Now, Daddy!" she cried. "Don't be absurd! It's too silly for words. I
refuse to be betted on like this."
"Quite right, dear," her mother said. "Stop it at once, Mike, and sit down
and eat your food."
Mike ignored her. He looked over at his daughter and he smiled, a slow,
fatherly, protective smile. But in his eyes, suddenly, there glimmered a little
triumph. "You know," he said, smiling as he spoke. "You know, Louise, we ought to
think about this a bit."
"Now, stop it, Daddy! I refuse even to listen to you! Why, I've never heard
anything so ridiculous in my life!"
"No, seriously, my dear. Just wait a moment and hear what I have to say."
"But I don't want to hear it."
"Louise! Please! It's like this. Richard, here, has offered us a serious
bet. He is the one who wants to make it, not me. And if he loses, he will have to
hand over a considerable amount of property. Now, wait a minute, my dear, don't
interrupt. The point is this. He cannot possibly win."
"He seems to think he can."
"Now listen to me, because I know what I'm talking about. The expert, when
tasting a claret--so long as it is not one of the famous great wines like Lafite
or Latour--can only get a certain way towards naming the vineyard. He can, of
course, tell you the Bordeaux district from which the wine comes, whether it is
from St Emilion, Pomerol, Graves, or M�doc. But then each district has several
communes, little counties, and each county has many, many small vineyards. It is
impossible for a man to differentiate between them all by taste and smell alone. I
don't mind telling you that this one I've got here is a wine from a small vineyard
that is surrounded by many other small vineyards, and he'll never get it. It's
impossible."
"You can't be sure of that," his daughter said.
"I'm telling you I can. Though I say it myself, I understand quite a bit
about this wine business, you know. And anyway, heavens alive, girl, I'm your
father and you don't think I'd let you in for--for something you didn't want, do
you? I'm trying to make you some money."
"Mike!" his wife said sharply. "Stop it now, Mike, please!"
Again he ignored her. "If you will take this bet," he said to his daughter,
"in ten minutes you will be the owner of two large houses."
"But I don't want two large houses, Daddy."
"Then sell them. Sell them back to him on the spot. I'll arrange all that
for you. And then, just think of it, my dear, you'll be rich! You'll be
independent for the rest of your life!"
"Oh, Daddy, I don't like it. I think it's silly."
"So do I," the mother said. She jerked her head briskly up and down as she
spoke, like a hen. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Michael, even suggesting
such a thing! Your own daughter, too!"
Mike didn't even look at her. "Take it!" he said eagerly, staring hard at
the girl. "Take it, quick! I'll guarantee you won't lose."
"But I don't like it, Daddy."
"Come on, girl. Take it!"
Mike was pushing her hard. He was leaning towards her, fixing her with two
hard bright eyes, and it was not easy for the daughter to resist him.
"But what if I lose?"
"I keep telling you, you can't lose. I'll guarantee it."
"Oh, Daddy must I?"
"I'm making you a fortune. So come on now. What do you say, Louise? All
right?"
For the last time, she hesitated. Then she gave a helpless little shrug of
the shoulders and said, "Oh, all right, then. Just so long as you swear there's no
danger of losing."
"Good!" Mike cried. "That's fine! Then it's a bet!"
"Yes," Richard Pratt said, looking at the girl. "It's a bet."
Immediately, Mike picked up the wine, tipped the first thimbleful into his
own glass, then skipped excitedly around the table filling up the others. Now
everyone was watching Richard Pratt, watching his face as he reached slowly for
his glass with his right hand and lifted it to his nose. The man was about fifty
years old and he did not have a pleasant face. Somehow, it was all mouth--mouth
and lips--the full, wet lips of the professional gourmet, the lower lip hanging
downward in the centre, a pendulous, permanently open taster's lip, shaped open to
receive the rim of a glass or a morsel of food. Like a keyhole, I thought,
watching it; his mouth is like a large wet keyhole.
Slowly he lifted the glass to his nose. The point of the nose entered the
glass and moved over the surface of the wine, delicately sniffing. He swirled the
wine gently around in the glass to receive the bouquet. His concentration was
intense. He had closed his eyes, and now the whole top half of his body, the head
and neck and chest, seemed to become a kind of huge sensitive smelling-machine,
receiving, filtering, analysing the message from the sniffing nose.
Mike, I noticed, was lounging in his chair, apparently unconcerned, but he
was watching every move. Mrs Schofield, the wife, sat prim and upright at the
other end of the table, looking straight ahead, her face tight with disapproval.
The daughter, Louise, had shifted her chair away a little, and sidewise, facing
the gourmet, and she, like her father, was watching closely.
For at least a minute, the smelling process continued; then, without opening
his eyes or moving his head, Pratt lowered the glass to his mouth and tipped in
almost half the contents. He paused, his mouth full of wine, getting the first
taste; then, he permitted some of it to trickle down his throat and I saw his
Adam's apple move as it passed by. But most of it he retained in his mouth. And
now, without swallowing again, he drew in through the lips a thin breath of air
which mingled with the fumes of the wine in the mouth and passed on down into his
lungs. He held the breath, blew it out through his nose, and finally began to roll
the wine around under the tongue, and chewed it, actually chewed it with his teeth
as though it were bread.
It was a solemn, impressive performance, and I must say he did it well.
"Urn," he said, putting down the glass, running a pink tongue over his lips,
"Urn--yes. A very interesting little wine gentle and gracious, almost feminine in
the after-taste."
There was an excess of saliva in his mouth, and as he spoke he spat an
occasional bright speck of it on to the table.
"Now we can start to eliminate," he said. "You will pardon me for doing this
carefully, but there is much at stake. Normally I would perhaps take a bit of a
chance, leaping forward quickly and landing right in the middle of the vineyard of
my choice. But this time--I must move cautiously this time, must I not?" He looked
up at Mike and he smiled, a thick-lipped, wet-lipped smile. Mike did not smile
back.
"First, then, which district in Bordeaux does this wine come from? That's
not too difficult to guess. It is far too light in the body to be from either St
Emilion or Graves. It is obviously a M�doc. There's no doubt about that.
"Now- from which commune in M�doc does it come? That also, by elimination,
should not be too difficult to decide. Margaux? No. It cannot be Margaux. It has
not the violent bouquet of a Margaux. Pauillac? It cannot be Pauillac, either. It
is too tender, too gentle and wistful for Pauillac. The wine of Pauillac has a
character that is almost imperious in its taste. And also, to me, a Pauillac
contains just a little pith, a curious dusty, pithy flavour that the grape
acquires from the soil of the district. No, no. This--this is a very gentle wine,
demure and bashful in the first taste, emerging shyly but quite graciously in the
second. A little arch, perhaps, in the second taste, and a little naughty also,
teasing the tongue with a trace, just a trace of tannin. Then, in the after-taste,
delightful--consoling and feminine, with a certain blithely generous quality that
one associates only with the wines of the commune of St Julien. Unmistakably this
is a St Julien."
He leaned back in his chair, held his hands up level with his chest, and
placed the fingertips carefully together. He was becoming ridiculously Pompous,
but I thought that some of it was deliberate, simply to mock his host. I found
myself waiting rather tensely for him to go on. The girl Louise was lighting a
cigarette. Pratt heard the match strike and he turned on her, flaring suddenly
with real anger. "Please!" he said. "Please don't do that! It's a disgusting
habit, to smoke at table!"
She looked up at him, still holding the burning match in one hand, the big
slow eyes settling on his face, resting there a moment, moving away again, slow
and contemptuous. She bent her head and blew out the match, but continued to hold
the unlighted cigarette in her fingers.
"I'm sorry, my dear," Pratt said, "but I simply cannot have smoking at
table."
She didn't look at him again.
"Now, let me see--where were we?" he said. "Ah, yes. This wine is from
Bordeaux, from the commune of St Julien, in the district of M�doc. So far, so
good. But now we come to the more difficult part--the name of the vineyard itself.
For in St Julien there are many vineyards, and as our host so rightly remarked
earlier on, there is often not much difference between the wine of one and wine of
another. But we shall see."
He paused again, closing his eyes. "I am trying to establish the 'growth',"
he said. "If I can do that, it will be half the battle. Now, let me see. This wine
is obviously not from a first-growth vineyard nor even a second. It is not a great
wine. The quality, the--the--what do you call it?--the radiance, the power, is
lacking. But a third growth--that it could be. And yet I doubt it. We know it is a
good year--our host has said so--and this is probably flattering it a little bit.
I must be careful. I must be very careful here."
He picked up his glass and took another small sip.
"Yes," he said, sucking his lips, "I was right. It is a fourth growth. Now I
am sure of it. A fourth growth from a very good year from a great year, in fact.
And that's what made it taste for a moment like a third--or even a second-growth
wine. Good! That's better! Now we are closing in! What are the fourth-growth
vineyards in the commune of St Julien?"
Again he paused, took up his glass, and held the rim against that sagging,
pendulous lower lip of his. Then I saw the tongue shoot out, pink and narrow, the
tip of it dipping into the wine, withdrawing swiftly again--a repulsive sight.
When he lowered the glass, his eyes remained closed, the face concentrated, only
the lips moving, sliding over each other like two pieces of wet, spongy rubber.
"There it is again!" he cried. "Tannin in the middle taste, and the quick
astringent squeeze upon the tongue. Yes, yes, of course! Now I have it! The wine
comes from one of those small vineyards around Beychevelle. I remember now. The
Beychevelle district, and the river and the little harbour that has silted up so
the wine ships can no longer use it. Beychevelle... could it actually be a
Beychevelle itself? No, I don't think so. Not quite. But it is somewhere very
close. Ch�teau Talbot? Could it be Talbot? Yes, it could. Wait one moment."
He sipped the wine again, and out of the side of my eye I noticed Mike
Schofield and how he was leaning farther and farther forward over the table, his
mouth slightly open, his small eyes fixed upon Richard Pratt.
"No. I was wrong. It is not a Talbot. A Talbot comes forward to you just a
little quicker than this one; the fruit is nearer the surface. If it is a '34,
which I believe it is, then it couldn't be Talbot. Well, well. Let me think. It is
not a Beychevelle and it is not a Talbot, and yet--yet it is so close to both of
them, so close, that the vineyard must be almost in between. Now, which could that
be?"
He hesitated, and we waited, watching his face. Everyone, even Mike's wife,
was watching him now. I heard the maid put down the dish of vegetables on the
sideboard behind me, gently, so as not to disturb the silence.
"Ah!" he cried. "I have it! Yes, I think I have it!"
For the last time, he sipped the wine. Then, still holding the glass up near
his mouth, he turned to Mike and he smiled, a slow, silky smile, and he said, "You
know what this is? This is the little Ch�teau Branaire-Ducru."
Mike sat tight, not moving.
"And the year, 1934."
We all looked at Mike, waiting for him to turn the bottle around in its
basket and show the label.
"Is that your final answer?" Mike said.
"Yes, I think so."
"Well, is it or isn't it?"
"Yes, it is."
"What was the name again?"
"Ch�teau Branaire-Ducru. Pretty little vineyard. Lovely old ch�teau. Know it
quite well. Can't think why I didn't recognize it at once."
"Come on, Daddy," the girl said. "Turn it round and let's have a peek. I
want my two houses."
"Just a minute," Mike said. "Wait just a minute." He was sitting very quiet,
bewilderedlooking, and his face was becoming puffy and pale, as though all the
force was draining slowly out of him.
"Michael!" his wife called sharply from the other end of the table. "What's
the matter?"
"Keep out of this, Margaret, will you please."
Richard Pratt was looking at Mike, smiling with his mouth, his eyes small
and bright. Mike was not looking at anyone.
"Daddy!" the daughter cried, agonized. "But, Daddy, you don't mean to say he
guessed it right!"
"Now, stop worrying, my dear," Mike said. "There's nothing to worry about."
I think it was more to get away from his family than anything else that Mike
then turned to Richard Pratt and said, "I'll tell you what, Richard. I think you
and I better slip off into the next room and have a little chat."
"I don't want a little chat," Pratt said. "All I want is to see the label on
that bottle." He knew he was a winner now; he had the bearing, the quiet arrogance
of a winner, and I could see that he was prepared to become thoroughly nasty if
there was any trouble. "What are you waiting for?" he said to Mike. "Go on and
turn it round."
Then this happened: the maid, the tiny, erect figure of the maid in her
white-and-black uniform, was standing beside Richard Pratt, holding something out
in her hand. "I believe these are yours, sir," she said.
Pratt glanced around, saw the pair of thin horn-rimmed spectacles that she
held out to him, and for a moment he hesitated. "Are they? Perhaps they are, I
don't know."
"Yes, sir, they're yours." The maid was an elderly woman--nearer seventy
than sixty--a faithful family retainer of many years' standing. She put the
spectacles down on the table beside him.
Without thanking her, Pratt took them up and slipped them into his top
pocket, behind the white handkerchief.
But the maid didn't go away. She remained standing beside and slightly
behind Richard Pratt, and there was something so unusual in her manner and in the
way she stood there, small, motionless and erect, that I for one found myself
watching her with a sudden apprehension. Her old grey face had a frosty,
determined look, the lips were compressed, the little chin was out, and the hands
were clasped together tight before her. The curious cap on her head and the flash
of white down the front of her uniform made her seem like some tiny, ruffled,
white-breasted bird.
"You left them in Mr Schofield's study," she said. Her voice was
unnaturally, deliberately polite. "On top of the green filing cabinet in his
study, sir, when you happened to go in there by yourself before dinner."
It took a few moments for the full meaning of her words to penetrate, and in
the silence that followed I became aware of Mike and how he was slowly drawing
himself up in his chair, and the colour coming to his face, and the eyes opening
wide, and the curl of the mouth, and the dangerous little patch of whiteness
beginning to spread around the area of the nostrils.
"Now, Michael!" his wife said. "Keep calm now, Michael dear! Keep calm!"
Lamb to the Slaughter
THE room was warm and clean, the curtains drawn, the two table lamps alight--hers
and the one by the empty chair opposite. On the sideboard behind her, two tall
glasses, soda water, whisky. Fresh ice cubes in the Thermos bucket.
Mary Maloney was waiting for her husband to come home from work.
Now and again she would glance up at the clock, but without anxiety, merely
to please herself with the thought that each minute gone by made it nearer the
time when he would come. There was a slow smiling air about her, and about
everything she did. The drop of the head as she bent over her sewing was curiously
tranquil. Her skin--for this was her sixth month with child--had acquired a
wonderful translucent quality, the mouth was soft, and the eyes, with their new
placid look, seemed larger, darker than before.
When the clock said ten minutes to five, she began to listen, and a few
moments later, punctually as always, she heard the tyres on the gravel outside,
and the car door slamming, the footsteps passing the window, the key turning in
the lock. She laid aside her sewing, stood up, and went forward to kiss him as he
came in.
"Hullo, darling," she said.
"Hullo," he answered. She took his coat and hung it in the closet. Then she
walked over and made the drinks, a strongish one for him, a weak one for herself;
and soon she was back again in her chair with the sewing, and he in the other,
opposite, holding the tall glass with both his hands, rocking it so the ice cubes
tinkled against the side.
For her, this was always a blissful time of day. She knew he didn't want to
speak much until the first drink was finished, and she, on her side, was content
to sit quietly, enjoying his company after the long hours alone in the house. She
loved to luxuriate in the presence of this man, and to feel--almost as a sunbather
feels the sun that warm male glow that came out of him to her when they were alone
together. She loved him for the way he sat loosely in a chair, for the way he came
in a door, or moved slowly across the room with long strides. She loved the
intent, far look in his eyes when they rested on her, the funny shape of the
mouth, and especially the way he remained silent about his tiredness, sitting
still with himself until the whisky had taken some of it away.
"Tired, darling?"
"Yes," he said. "I'm tired." And as he spoke, he did an unusual thing. He
lifted his glass and drained it in one swallow although there was still half of
it, at least half of it, left. She wasn't really watching him but she knew what he
had done because she heard the ice cubes falling back against the bottom of the
empty glass when he lowered his arm. He paused a moment, leaning forward in the
chair, then he got up and went slowly over to fetch himself another.
"I'll get it!" she cried, jumping up.
"Sit down," he said.
When he came back, she noticed that the new drink was dark amber with the
quantity of whisky in it.
"Darling, shall I get your slippers?"
She watched him as he began to sip the dark yellow drink, and she could see
little oily swirls in the liquid because it was so strong.
"I think it's a shame," she said, "that when a policeman gets to be as
senior as you, they keep him walking about on his feet all day long."
He didn't answer, so she bent her head again and went on with her sewing;
but each time he lifted the drink to his lips, she heard the ice cubes clinking
against the side of the glass.
"Darling," she said. "Would you like me to get you some cheese? I haven't
made any supper because it's Thursday."
"No," he said.
"If you're too tired to eat out," she went on, "it's still not too late.
There's plenty of meat and stuff in the freezer, and you can have it right here
and not even move out of the chair."
Her eyes waited on him for an answer, a smile, a little nod, but he made no
sign.
"Anyway," she went on, "I'll get you some cheese and crackers first."
"I don't want it," he said.
She moved uneasily in her chair, the large eyes still watching his face.
"But you must have supper. I can easily do it here. I'd like to do it. We can have
lamb chops. Or pork. Anything you want. Everything's in the freezer."
"Forget it," he said.
"But, darling, you must eat! I'll fix it anyway, and then you can have it or
not, as you like."
She stood up and placed her sewing on the table by the lamp.
"Sit down," he said. "Just for a minute, sit down."
It wasn't till then that she began to get frightened.
"Go on," he said. "Sit down."
She lowered herself back slowly into the chair, watching him all the time
with those large, bewildered eyes. He had finished the second drink and was
staring down into the glass frowning.
"Listen," he said, "I've got something to tell you."
"What is it, darling? 'What's the matter?"
He had become absolutely motionless, and he kept his head down so that the
light from the lamp beside him fell across the upper part of his face, leaving the
chin and mouth in shadow. She noticed there was a little muscle moving near the
corner of his left eye.
"This is going to be a bit of a shock to you, I'm afraid," he said. "But
I've thought about it a good deal and I've decided the only thing to do is tell
you right away. I hope you won't blame me too much."
And he told her. It didn't take long, four or five minutes at most, and she
sat very still through it all, watching him with a kind of dazed horror as he went
further and further away from her with each word.
"So there it is," he added. "And I know it's kind of a bad time to be
telling you, but there simply wasn't any other way. Of course I'll give you money
and see you're looked after. But there needn't really be any fuss. I hope not
anyway. It wouldn't be very good for my job."
Her first instinct was not to believe any of it, to reject it all. It
occurred to her that perhaps he hadn't even spoken, that she herself had imagined
the whole thing. Maybe, if she went about her business and acted as though she
hadn't been listening, then later, when she sort of woke up again, she might find
none of it had ever happened.
"I'll get the supper," she managed to whisper, and this time he didn't stop
her.
When she walked across the room she couldn't feel her feet touching the
floor. She couldn't feel anything at all--except a slight nausea and a desire to
vomit. Everything was automatic now--down the stairs to the cellar, the light
switch, the deep freeze, the hand inside the cabinet taking hold of the first
object it met. She lifted it out, and looked at it. It was wrapped in paper, so
she took off the paper and looked at it again.
A leg of lamb.
All right then, they would have lamb for supper. She carried it upstairs,
holding the thin bone-end of it with both her hands, and as she went through the
living-room, she saw him standing over by the window with his back to her, and she
stopped.
"For God's sake," he said, hearing her, but not turning round. "Don't make
supper for me. I'm going out."
At that point, Mary Maloney simply walked up behind him and without any
pause she swung the big frozen leg of lamb high in the air and brought it down as
hard as she could on the back of his head.
She might just as well have hit him with a steel club.
She stepped back a pace, waiting, and the funny thing was that he remained
standing there for at least four or five seconds, gently swaying. Then he crashed
to the carpet.
The violence of the crash, the noise, the small table overturning, helped
bring her out of the shock. She came out slowly, feeling cold and surprised, and
she stood for a while blinking at the body, still holding the ridiculous piece of
meat tight with both hands.
All right, she told herself. So I've killed him.
It was extraordinary, now, how clear her mind became all of a sudden. She
began thinking very fast. As the wife of a detective, she knew quite well what the
penalty would be. That was fine. It made no difference to her. In fact, it would
be a relief. On the other hand, what about the child? What were the laws about
murderers with unborn children? Did they kill them both--mother and child? Or did
they wait until the tenth month? What did they do?
Mary Maloney didn't know. And she certainly wasn't prepared to take a
chance.
She carried the meat into the kitchen, placed it in a pan, turned the oven
on high, and shoved it inside. Then she washed her hands and ran upstairs to the
bedroom. She sat down before the mirror, tidied her face, touched up her lips and
face. She tried a smile. It came out rather peculiar. She tried again.
"Hullo Sam," she said brightly, aloud.
The voice sounded peculiar too.
"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas."
That was better. Both the smile and the voice were coming out better now.
She rehearsed it several times more. Then she ran downstairs, took her coat, went
out the back door, down the garden, into the street.
It wasn't six o'clock yet and the lights were still on in the grocery shop.
"Hullo Sam," she said brightly, smiling at the man behind the counter.
"Why, good evening, Mrs Maloney. How're you?"
"I want some potatoes please, Sam. Yes, and I think a can of peas."
The man turned and reached up behind him on the shelf for the peas.
"Patrick's decided he's tired and doesn't want to eat out tonight," she told
him. "We usually go out Thursdays, you know, and now he's caught me without any
vegetables in the house."
"Then how about meat, Mrs Maloney?"
"No, I've got meat, thanks. I got a nice leg of lamb, from the freezer."
"ih.
"I don't much like cooking it frozen, Sam, but I'm taking a chance on it
this time. You think it'll be all right?"
"Personally," the grocer said, "I don't believe it makes any difference. You
want these Idaho potatoes?"
"Oh yes, that'll be fine. Two of those."
"Anything else?" The grocer cocked his head on one side, looking at her
pleasantly. "How about afterwards? What you going to give him for afterwards?"
"Well what would you suggest, Sam?"
The man glanced around his shop. "How about a nice big slice of cheesecake?
I know he likes that."
"Perfect," she said. "He loves it."
And when it was all wrapped and she had paid she put on her brightest smile
and said, "Thank you, Sam. Good night."
"Good night, Mrs Maloney. And thank you."
And now, she told herself as she hurried back, all she was doing now, she
was returning home to her husband and he was waiting for his supper; and she must
cook it good, and make it as tasty as possible because the poor man was tired; and
if, when she entered the house, she happened to find anything unusual, or tragic,
or terrible, then naturally it would be a shock and she'd become frantic with
grief and horror. Mind you, she wasn't expecting to find anything. She was just
going home with the vegetables. Mrs Patrick Maloney going home with the vegetables
on Thursday evening to cook supper for her husband.
That's the way, she told herself. Do everything right and natural. Keep
things absolutely natural and there'll be no need for any acting at all.
Therefore, when she entered the kitchen by the back door, she was humming a
little tune to herself and smiling.
"Patrick!" she called. "How are you darling?"
She put the parcel down on the table and went through into the living-room;
and when she saw him lying there on the floor with his legs doubled up and one arm
twisted back underneath his body, it really was rather a shock. All the old love
and longing for him welled up inside her, and she ran over to him, knelt down
beside him, and began to cry her heart out. It was easy. No acting was necessary.
A few minutes later she got up and went to the phone. She knew the number of
the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him,
"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!"
"Who's speaking?"
"Mrs Maloney. Mrs Patrick Maloney."
"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?"
"I think so," she sobbed. "He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead."
"Be right over," the man said.
The car came over quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policemen
walked in. She knew them both--she knew nearly all the men at that precinct--and
she fell right into Jack Noonan's arms, weeping hysterically. He put her gently
into a chair, then went over to join the other one, who was called O'Malley,
kneeling by the body.
"Is he dead?" she cried.
"I'm afraid he is. What happened?"
Briefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to
find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan
discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it
to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone.
Soon, other men began to come into the house. First a doctor, then two
detectives, one of whom she knew by name. Later, a police photographer arrived and
took pictures, and a man who knew about fingerprints. There was a great deal of
whispering and muttering beside the corpse, and the detectives kept asking her a
lot of questions. But they always treated her kindly. She told her story again,
this time right from the beginning, when Patrick had come in, and she was sewing,
and he was tired, so tired he hadn't wanted to go out for supper. She told how
she'd put the meat in the oven--"it's there now, cooking"--and how she'd slipped
out to the grocer for vegetables, and come back to find him lying on the floor.
"Which grocer?" one of the detectives asked.
She told him, and he turned and whispered something to the other detective
who immediately went outside into the street.
In fifteen minutes he was back with a page of notes, and there was more
whispering, and through her sobbing she heard a few of the whispered phrases "...
acted quite normal very cheerful... wanted to give him a good supper... peas...
cheesecake... impossible that she..
After a while, the photographer and the doctor departed and two other men
came in and took the corpse away on a stretcher. Then the fingerprint man went
away. The two detectives remained, and so did the two policemen. They were
exceptionally nice to her, and Jack Noonan asked if she wouldn't rather go
somewhere else, to her sister's house perhaps, or to his own wife who would take
care of her and put her up for the night.
No, she said. She didn't feel she could move even a yard at the moment.
Would they mind awfully if she stayed just where she was until she felt better?
She didn't feel too good at the moment, she really didn't.
Then hadn't she better lie down on the bed? Jack Noonan asked.
No, she said, she'd like to stay right where she was, in this chair. A
little later perhaps, when she felt better, she would move.
So they left her there while they went about their business, searching the
house. Occasionally one of the detectives asked her another question. Sometimes
Jack Noonan spoke to her gently as he passed by. Her husband, he told her, had
been killed by a blow on the back of the head administered with a heavy blunt
instrument, almost certainly a large piece of metal. They were looking for the
weapon. The murderer may have taken it with him, but on the other hand he may've
thrown it away or hidden it somewhere on the premises.
"It's the old story," he said. "Get the weapon, and you've got the man."
Later, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he
asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she
mind having a look around to see if anything was missing a very big spanner for
example, or a heavy metal vase.
They didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said.
"Or a big spanner?"
She didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like
that in the garage.
The search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden
all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and
sometimes she saw the flash of a torch through a chink in the curtains. It began
to get late, nearly nine she noticed by the clock on the mantel. The four men
searching the rooms seemed to be growing weary, a trifle exasperated.
"Jack," she said, the next time Sergeant Noonan went by. "Would you mind
giving me a drink?"
"Sure I'll give you a drink. You mean this whisky?"
"Yes, please. But just a small one. It might make me feel better."
He handed her the glass. "Why don't you have one yourself," she said. "You
must be awfully tired. Please do. You've been very good to me."
"Well," he answered. "It's not strictly allowed, but I might take just a
drop to keep me going."
One by one the others came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of
whisky. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands,
uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant
Noonan wandered into the kitchen, came out quickly and said, "Look, Mrs Maloney.
You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside."
"Oh dear me!" she cried. "So it is!"
"I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?"
"Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much."
When the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her
large, dark, tearful eyes. "Jack Noonan," she said.
"Yes?"
"Would you do me a small favour--you and these others?"
"We can try, Mrs Maloney."
"Well," she said. "Here you all are, and good friends of dear Patrick's too,
and helping to catch the man who killed him. You must be terribly hungry by now
because it's long past your supper time, and I know Patrick would never forgive
me, God bless his soul, if I allowed you to remain in his house without offering
you decent hospitality. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven? It'll
be cooked just right by now."
"Wouldn't dream of it," Sergeant Noonan said.
"Please," she begged. "Please eat it. Personally I couldn't touch a thing,
certainly not what's been in the house when he was here. But it's all right for
you. It'd be a favour to me if you'd eat it up. Then you can go on with your work
again afterwards."
There was a good deal of hesitating among the four policemen, but they were
clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help
themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them through the open
door, and she could hear them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and
sloppy because their mouths were full of meat.
"Have some more, Charlie?"
"No. Better not finish it."
"She wants us to finish it. She said so. Be doing her a favour."
"Okay then. Give me some more."
"That is the hell of a big club the guy must've used to hit poor Patrick,"
one of them was saying. "The doc says his skull was smashed all to pieces just
like from a sledge-hammer."
"That is why it ought to be easy to find."
"Exactly what I say."
"Whoever done it, they're not going to be carrying a thing like that around
with them longer than they need."
One of them belched. "Personally, I think it's right here on the premises."
"Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?"
And in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle.
Man from the South
IT was getting on towards six o'clock so I thought I'd buy myself a beer and go
out and sit in a deckchair by the swimming pool and have a little evening sun.
I went to the bar and got the beer and carried it outside and wandered down
the garden towards the pool.
It was a fine garden with lawns and beds of azaleas and tall coconut palms,
and the wind was blowing strongly through the tops of the palm trees, making the
leaves hiss and crackle as though they were on fire. I could see the clusters of
big brown nuts hanging down underneath the leaves.
There were plenty of deck chairs around the swimming pool and there were
white tables and huge brightly coloured umbrellas and sunburned men and women
sitting around in bathing suits. In the pool itself there were three or four girls
and about a dozen boys, all splashing about and making a lot of noise and throwing
a large rubber ball at one another.
I stood watching them. The girls were English girls from the hotel. The boys
I didn't know about, but they sounded American, and I thought they were probably
naval cadets who'd come ashore from the US naval training vessel which had arrived
in harbour that morning.
I went over and sat down under a yellow umbrella where there were four empty
seats, and I poured my beer and settled back comfortably with a cigarette.
It was very pleasant sitting there in the sunshine with beer and cigarette.
It was pleasant to sit and watch the bathers splashing about in the green water.
The American sailors were getting on nicely with the English girls. They'd
reached the stage where they were diving under the water and tipping them up by
their legs.
Just then I noticed a small, oldish man walking briskly around the edge of
the pool. He was immaculately dressed in a white suit and he walked very quickly
with little bouncing strides, pushing himself high up on to his toes with each
step. He had on a large creamy Panama hat, and he came bouncing along the side of
the pool, looking at the people and the chairs.
He stopped beside me and smiled, showing two rows of very small, uneven
teeth, slightly tarnished. I smiled back.
"Excuse pleess, but may I sit here?"
"Certainly," I said. "Go ahead."
He bobbed around to the back of the chair and inspected it for safety, then
he sat down and crossed his legs. His white buckskin shoes had little holes
punched all over them for ventilation.
"A fine evening," he said. "They are all evenings fine here in Jamaica." I
couldn't tell if the accent were Italian or Spanish, but I felt fairly sure he was
some sort of a South American. And old too, when you saw him close. Probably
around sixty-eight or seventy.
"Yes," I said. "It is wonderful here, isn't it."
"And who, might I ask, are all dese? Dese is no hotel people." He was
pointing at the bathers in the pool.
"I think they're American sailors," I told him. "They're Americans who are
learning to be sailors."
"Of course dey are Americans. Who else in de world is going to make as much
noise as dat? You are not American no?"
"No," I said. "I am not."
Suddenly one of the American cadets was standing in front of us. He was
dripping wet from the pool and one of the English girls was standing there with
him.
"Are these chairs taken?" he said.
"No," I answered.
"Mind if I sit down?"
"Go ahead."
"Thanks," he said. He had a towel in his hand and when he sat down he
unrolled it and produced a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He offered the
cigarettes to the girl and she refused; then he offered them to me and I took one.
The little man said, "Tank you, no, but I tink I have a cigar." He pulled out a
crocodile case and got himself a cigar, then he produced a knife which had a small
scissors in it and he snipped the end off the cigar.
"Here, let me give you a light." The American boy held up his lighter.
"Dat will not work in dis wind."
"Sure it'll work. It always works." The little man removed his unlighted
cigar from his mouth, cocked his head on one side and looked at the boy.
"All-ways?" he said slowly.
"Sure, it never fails. Not with me anyway."
The little man's head was still cocked over on one side and he was still
watching the boy. "Well, well. So you say dis famous lighter it never fails. Iss
dat you say?"
"Sure," the boy said. "That's right." He was about nineteen or twenty with a
long freckled face and a rather sharp birdlike nose. His chest was not very
sunburned and there were freckles there too, and a few wisps of pale-reddish hair.
He was holding the lighter in his right hand, ready to flip the wheel. "It never
fails," he said, smiling now because he was purposely exaggerating his little
boast. "I promise you it never fails."
"One momint, pleess." The hand that held the cigar came up high, palm
outward, as though it were stopping traffic. "Now juss one momint." He had a
curiously soft, toneless voice and he kept looking at the boy all the time.
"Shall we not perhaps make a little bet on dat?" He smiled at the boy.
"Shall we not make a little bet on whether your lighter lights?"
"Sure, I'll bet," the boy said. "Why not?"
"You like to bet?"
"Sure, I'll always bet."
The man paused and examined his cigar, and I must say I didn't much like the
way he was behaving. It seemed he was already trying to make something out of
this, and to embarrass the boy, and at the same time I had the feeling he was
relishing a private little secret all his own.
He looked up again at the boy and said slowly, "I like to bet, too. Why we
don't have a good bet on dis ting? A good big bet."
"Now wait a minute," the boy said. "I can't do that. But I'll bet you a
quarter. I'll even bet you a dollar, or whatever it is over here--some shillings,
I guess."
The little man waved his hand again. "Listen to me. Now we have some fun. We
make a bet. Den we go up to my room here in de hotel where iss no wind and I bet
you you cannot light dis famous lighter of yours ten times running without missing
once."
"I'll bet I can," the boy said.
"All right. Good. We make a bet, yes?"
"Sure, I'll bet you a buck."
"No, no I make you a very good bet. I am rich man and I am sporting man
also. Listen to me. Outside de hotel iss my car. Iss very fine car. American car
from your country. Cadillac-- "Hey, now. Wait a minute." The boy leaned back in
his deck-chair and he laughed. "I can't put up that sort of property. This is
crazy."
"Not crazy at all. You strike lighter successfully ten times running and
Cadillac is yours. You like to have dis Cadillac, yes?"
"Sure, I'd like to have a Cadillac." The boy was still grinning.
"All right. Fine. We make a bet and I put up my Cadillac."
"And what do I put up?" The little man carefully removed the red band from
his still unlighted cigar. "I never ask you, my friend, to bet something you
cannot afford. You understand?"
"Then what do I bet?"
"I make it very easy for you, yes?"
"Okay. You make it easy."
"Some small ting you can afford to give away, and if you did happen to lose
it you would not feel too bad. Right?"
"Such as what?"
"Such as, perhaps, de little finger on your left hand."
"My what?" The boy stopped grinning.
"Yes. Why not? You win, you take de car. You boss, I take de finger."
"I don't get it. How d'you mean, you take the finger?"
"I chop it off."
"Jumping jeepers! That's a crazy bet. I think I'll just make it a dollar."
The little man leaned back, spread out his hands palms upwards and gave a
tiny contemptuous shrug of the shoulders, "Well, well, well," he said. "I do not
understand. You say it lights but you will not bet. Den we forget it, yes?"
The boy sat quite still, staring at the bathers in the pool. Then he
remembered suddenly he hadn't lighted his cigarette. He put it between his lips,
cupped his hands around the lighter and flipped the wheel. The wick lighted and
burned with a small, steady, yellow flame and the way he held his hands the wind
didn't get to it at all. "Could I have a light, too?" I said.
"God, I'm sorry, I forgot you didn't have one."
I held out my hand for the lighter, but he stood up and came over to do it
for me.
"Thank you," I said, and he returned to his seat.
"You having a good time?" I asked.
"Fine," he answered. "It's pretty nice here."
There was a silence then, and I could see that the little man had succeeded
in disturbing the boy with his absurd proposal. He was sitting there very still,
and it was obvious that a small tension was beginning to build up inside him. Then
he started shifting about in his seat, and rubbing his chest, and stroking the
back of his neck, and finally he placed both hands on his knees and began taptapping
with his fingers against the kneecaps. Soon he was tapping with one of his
feet as well.
"Now just let me check up on this bet of yours," he said at last. "You say
we go up to your room and if I make this lighter light ten times running I win a
Cadillac. If it misses just once then I forfeit the little finger of my left hand.
Is that right?
"Certainly. Dat is de bet. But I tink you are afraid."
"What do we do if I lose? Do I have to hold my finger out while you chop it
off?"
"Oh, no! Dat would be no good. And you might be tempted to refuse to hold it
out. What I should do I should tie one of your hands to de table before we started
and I should stand dere with a knife ready to go chop de momint your lighter
missed."
"What year is the Cadillac?" the boy asked.
"Excuse. I not understand."
"What year--how old is the Cadillac?"
"Ah! How old? Yes. It is last year. Quite new car. But I see you are not
betting man. Americans never are."
The boy paused for just a moment and he glanced first at the English girl,
then at me. "Yes," he said sharply. "I'll bet you."
"Good!" The little man clapped his hands together quietly, once. "Fine," he
said. "We do it now. And you, sir," he turned to me, "you would perhaps be good
enough to, what you call it, to to referee." He had pale, almost colourless eyes
with tiny bright black pupils.
"Well," I said. "I think it's a crazy bet. I don't think I like it very
much."
"Nor do I," said the English girl. It was the first time she'd spoken. "I
think it's a stupid, ridiculous bet."
"Are you serious about cutting off this boy's finger if he loses?" I said.
"Certainly I am. Also about giving him Cadillac if he win. Come now. We go
to my room."
He stood up. "You like to put on some clothes first?" he said.
"No," the boy answered. "I'll come like this." Then he turned to me. "I'd
consider it a favour if you'd come along and referee."
"All right," I said. "I'll come along, but I don't like the bet."
"You come too," he said to the girl. "You come and watch."
The little man led the way back through the garden to the hotel. He was
animated now, and excited, and that seemed to make him bounce up higher than ever
on his toes as he walked along.
"I live in annexe," he said. "You like to see car first? Iss just here."
He took us to where we could see the front driveway of the hotel and he
stopped and pointed to a sleek pale-green Cadillac parked close by.
"Dere she iss. De green one. You like?"
"Say, that's a nice car," the boy said.
"All right. Now we go up and see if you can win her."
We followed him into the annexe and up one flight of stairs. He unlocked his
door and we all trooped into what was a large pleasant double bedroom. There was a
woman's dressing-gown lying across the bottom of one of the beds.
"First," he said, "we 'ave a little Martini."
The drinks were on a small table in the far corner, all ready to be mixed,
and there was a shaker and ice and plenty of glasses. He began to make the
Martini, but meanwhile he'd rung the bell and now there was a knock on the door
and a coloured maid came in.
"Ah!" he said, putting down the bottle of gin, taking a wallet from his
pocket and pulling out a pound note. "You will do something for me flow, pleess."
He gave the maid the pound.
"You keep dat," he said. "And now we are going to play a little game in here
and I want you to go off and find for me two no tree tings. I want some nails, I
want a hammer, and I want a chopping knife, a butcher's chopping knife which you
can borrow from de kitchen. You can get, yes?"
"A chopping knife!" The maid opened her eyes wide and clasped her hands in
front of her. "You mean a real chopping knife?"
"Yes, yes, of course. Come on now, pleess. You can find dose tings surely
for me."
"Yes, sir, I'll try, sir. Surely I'll try to get them." And she went.
The little man handed round the Martinis. We stood there and sipped them,
the boy with the long freckled face and the pointed nose, bare-bodied except for a
pair of faded brown bathing shorts; the English girl, a large-boned fair-haired
girl wearing a pale blue bathing suit, who watched the boy over the top of her
glass all the time; the little man with the colourless eyes standing there in his
immaculate white suit drinking his Martini and looking at the girl in her pale
blue bathing dress. I didn't know what to make of it all. The man seemed serious
about the bet and he seemed serious about the business of cutting off the finger.
But hell, what if the boy lost? Then we'd have to rush him to the hospital in the
Cadillac that he hadn't won. That would be a fine thing. Now wouldn't that be a
really fine thing? It would be a damn silly unnecessary thing so far as I could
see.
"Don't you think this is rather a silly bet?" I said. "I think it's a fine
bet," the boy answered. He had already downed one large Martini.
"I think it's a stupid, ridiculous bet," the girl said. "What'll happen if
you lose?"
"It won't matter. Come to think of it, I can't remember ever in my life
having had any use for the little finger on my left hand. Here he is." The boy
took hold of the finger. "Here he is and he hasn't ever done a thing for me yet.
So why shouldn't I bet him? I think it's a fine bet."
The little man smiled and picked up the shaker and refilled our glasses.
"Before we begin," he said, "I will present to de--to de referee de key of
de car." He produced a car key from his pocket and gave it to me. "De papers," he
said, "de owning papers and insurance are in de pocket of de car."
Then the coloured maid came in again. In one hand she carried a small
chopper, the kind used by butchers for chopping meat bones, and in the other a
hammer and a bag of nails.
"Good! You get dem all. Tank you, tank you. Now you can go." He waited until
the maid had closed the door, then he put the implements on one of the beds and
said, "Now we prepare ourselves, yes?" And to the boy, "Help me, pleess, with dis
table. We carry it out a little."
It was the usual kind of hotel writing desk, just a plain rectangular table
about four feet by three with a blotting pad, ink, pens and paper. They carried it
out into the room away from the wall, and removed the writing things.
"And now," he said, "a chair." He picked up a chair and placed it beside the
table. He was very brisk and very animated, like a person organizing games at a
children's party. "And now de nails. I must put in de nails." He fetched the nails
and he began to hammer them into the top of the table.
We stood there, the boy, the girl, and I, holding Martinis in our hands,
watching the little man at work. We watched him hammer two nails into the table,
about six inches apart. He didn't hammer them right home; he allowed a small part
of each one to stick up. Then he tested them for firmness with his fingers.
Anyone would think the son of a bitch had done this before, I told myself.
He never hesitates. Table, nails, hammer, kitchen chopper. He knows exactly what
he needs and how to arrange it.
"And now," he said, "all we want is some string." He found some string. "All
right, at last we are ready. Will you pleess to sit here at de table?" he said to
the boy.
The boy put his glass away and sat down.
"Now place de left hand between dese two nails. De nails are only so I can
tie your hand in place. All right, good. Now I tie your hand secure to de tableso."
He wound the string around the boy's wrist, then several times around the
wide part of the hand, then he fastened it tight to the nails. He made a good job
of it and when he'd finished there wasn't any question about the boy being able to
draw his hand away. But he could move his fingers. "Now pleess, clench de fist,
all except for de little finger. You must leave de little finger sticking out,
lying on de table."
"Ex-cellent! Ex-cellent! Now we are ready. Wid your right hand you
manipulate de lighter. But one moment, pleess."
He skipped over to the bed and picked up the chopper. He came back and stood
beside the table with the chopper in his hand.
"We are all ready?" he said. "Mister referee, you must say to begin."
The English girl was standing there in her pale blue bathing costume right
behind the boy's chair. She was just standing there, not saying anything. The boy
was sitting quite still holding the lighter in his right hand, looking at the
chopper. The little man was looking at me.
"Are you ready?" I asked the boy.
"I'm ready."
"And you?" to the little man.

THE LANDLADY
ROALD DAHL
Billy Weaver had travelled down from
London on the slow afternoon train, with a
change at Swindon on the way, and by the
time he got to Bath it was about nine
o’clock in the evening and the moon was
coming up out of a clear starry sky over
the houses opposite the station entrance.
But the air was deadly cold and the wind
was like a flat blade of ice on his cheeks.
 “Excuse me,” he said, “but is there a
fairly cheap hotel not too far away from
here?”
 “Try The Bell and Dragon,” the porter
answered, pointing down the road. “They
might take you in. It’s about a quarter of a
mile along on the other side.”
 Billy thanked him and picked up his
suitcase and set out to walk the quartermile
to The Bell and Dragon. He had
20 never been to Bath before. He didn’t know
anyone who lived there. But Mr
Greenslade at the Head Office in London
had told him it was a splendid city. “Find
your own lodgings,” he had said, “and
then go along and report to the Branch
Manager as soon as you’ve got yourself
settled.”
 Billy was seventeen years old. He was
wearing a new navy-blue overcoat, a new
brown trilby hat, and a new brown suit,
and he was feeling fine. He walked briskly
down the street. He was trying to do
everything briskly these days. Briskness,
he had decided, was the one common
characteristic of all successful
businessmen. The big shots up at Head
Office were absolutely fantastically brisk
all the time. They were amazing.
 There were no shops on this wide street
40 that he was walking along, only a line of
tall houses on each side, all them
identical. They had porches and pillars
and four or five steps going up to their
front doors, and it was obvious that once
upon a time they had been very swanky
residences. But now, even in the
darkness, he could see that the paint was
peeling from the woodwork on their doors
and windows, and that the handsome
white façades were cracked and blotchy from
neglect.
 Suddenly, in a downstairs window that was
brilliantly illuminated by a street-lamp not six
yards away, Billy caught sight of a printed
notice propped up against the glass in one of
the upper panes. It said BED AND
BREAKFAST. There was a vase of yellow
chrysanthemums, tall and beautiful, standing
just underneath the notice.
60 He stopped walking. He moved a bit closer.
 Green curtains (some sort of velvety
material) were hanging down on either side of
the window. The chrysanthemums looked
wonderful beside them. He went right up and
peered through the glass into the room, and
the first thing he saw was a bright fire burning
in the hearth. On the carpet in front of the fire,
a pretty little dachshund was curled up asleep
with its nose tucked into its belly.
 The room itself, so far as he could see in
the half-darkness, was filled with pleasant
furniture. There was a baby-grand piano and
a big sofa and several plump armchairs; and
in one corner he spotted a large parrot in a
cage. Animals were usually a good sign in a
place like this, Billy told himself; and all in all,
it looked to him as though it would be a pretty
decent house to stay in. Certainly it would be
more comfortable than The Bell and Dragon.
80 On the other hand, a pub would be more
congenial than a boarding-house. There
would be beer and darts in the evenings, and
lots of people to talk to, and it would probably
be a good bit cheaper, too. He had stayed a
couple of nights in a pub once before and he
had liked it. He had never stayed in any
boarding-houses, and, to be perfectly honest,
he was a tiny bit frightened of them. The
name itself conjured up images of watery
cabbage, rapacious landladies, and a
powerful smell of kippers in the living-room.
 After dithering about like this in the cold for
two or three minutes, Billy decided that he
would walk on and take a look at The Bell
and Dragon before making up his mind. He
turned to go. And now a queer thing
happened to him. He was in the act of
stepping back and turning away from the 
window when all at once his eye was
100 caught and held in the most peculiar
manner by the small notice that was there.
BED AND BREAKFAST, it said. BED AND
BREAKFAST, BED AND BREAKFAST,
BED AND BREAKFAST. Each word was
like a large black eye staring at him
through the glass, holding him, compelling
him, forcing him to stay where he was and
not to walk away from that house, and the
next thing he knew, he was actually
moving across from the window to the
front door of the house, climbing the steps
that led up to it, and reaching for the bell.
 He pressed the bell. Far away in a back
room he heard it ringing, and then at once
– it must have been at once because he
hadn’t even had time to take his finger
from the bell-button – the door swung
open and a woman was standing there.
 Normally you ring the bell and you have
120 at least a half-minute’s wait before the
door opens. But this dame was a like a
jack-in-the-box. He pressed the bell – and
out she popped! It made him jump.
 She was about forty-five or fifty years
old, and the moment she saw him, she
gave him a warm welcoming smile.
 “Please come in,” she said pleasantly.
She stepped aside, holding the door wide
open, and Billy found himself
automatically starting forward into the
house. The compulsion or, more
accurately, the desire to follow after her
into that house was extraordinarily strong.
 “I saw the notice in the window,” he said,
holding himself back.
 “Yes, I know.”
 “I was wondering about a room.”
 “It's all ready for you, my dear,” she said.
She had a round pink face and very gentle
140 blue eyes.
 “I was on my way to The Bell and
Dragon,” Billy told her. “But the notice in
your window just happened to catch my
eye.”
 “My dear boy,” she said, “why don't you
come in out of the cold?”
 “How much do you charge?”
 “Five and sixpence a night, including
breakfast.”
 It was fantastically cheap. It was less than
half of what he had been willing to pay.
 “If that is too much,” she added, “then
perhaps I can reduce it just a tiny bit. Do you
desire an egg for breakfast? Eggs are
expensive at the moment. It would be
sixpence less without the egg.”
 “Five and sixpence is fine,” he answered. “I
should like very much to stay here.”
 “I knew you would. Do come in.”
160 She seemed terribly nice. She looked
exactly like the mother of one’s best schoolfriend
welcoming one into the house to stay
for the Christmas holidays. Billy took off his
hat, and stepped over the threshold.
 “Just hang it there,” she said, “and let me
help you with your coat.”
 There were no other hats or coats in the
hall. There were no umbrellas, no walkingsticks
– nothing.
 “We have it all to ourselves,” she said,
smiling at him over her shoulder as she led
the way upstairs.
 “You see, it isn’t very often I have the
pleasure of taking a visitor into my little nest.”
 The old girl is slightly dotty, Billy told
himself. But at five and sixpence a night, who
gives a damn about that? – “I should've
thought you’d be simply swamped with
applicants,” he said politely.
180 “Oh, I am, my dear, I am, of course I am.
But the trouble is that I'm inclined to be just a
teeny weeny bit choosy and particular – if you
see what I mean.”
 “Ah, yes.”
 “But I’m always ready. Everything is always
ready day and night in this house just on the
off-chance that an acceptable young
gentleman will come along. And it is such a
pleasure, my dear, such a very great
pleasure when now and again I open the
door and I see someone standing there who
is just exactly right.” She was half-way up the
stairs, and she paused with one hand on the
stair-rail, turning her head and smiling down
at him with pale lips. “Like you,” she added,
and her blue eyes travelled slowly all the way
down the length of Billy's body, to his feet,
and then up again.
 On the first-floor landing she said to him,
200 “This floor is mine.”
 They climbed up a second flight. “And this
one is all yours,” she said. “Here’s your room. 
I do hope you’ll like it.” She took him into a
small but charming front bedroom,
switching on the light as she went in.
 “The morning sun comes right in the
window, Mr Perkins. It is Mr Perkins, isn’t
it?”
 “No,” he said. “It’s Weaver.”
 “Mr Weaver. How nice. I’ve put a waterbottle
between the sheets to air them out,
Mr Weaver. It’s such a comfort to have a
hot water-bottle in a strange bed with
clean sheets, don’t you agree?
And you may light the gas fire at any time
if you feel chilly.”
 “Thank you,” Billy said. “Thank you ever
so much.” He noticed that the bedspread
had been taken off the bed, and that the
220 bedclothes had been neatly turned back
on one side, all ready for someone to get
in.
 “I’m so glad you appeared,” she said,
looking earnestly into his face. “I was
beginning to get worried.”
 “That’s all right,” Billy answered brightly.
“You mustn’t worry about me.” He put his
suitcase on the chair and started to open
it.
 “And what about supper, my dear? Did
you manage to get anything to eat before
you came here?”
 “I’m not a bit hungry, thank you,” he
said. “I think I’ll just go to bed as soon as
possible because tomorrow I’ve got to get
up rather early and report to the office.”
 “Very well, then. I’ll leave you now so
that you can unpack. But before you go to
bed, would you be kind enough to pop into
240 the sitting-room on the ground floor and
sign the book? Everyone has to do that
because it’s the law of the land, and we
don’t want to go breaking any laws at this
stage in the proceedings, do we?” She
gave him a little wave of the hand and
went quickly out of the room and closed
the door.
 Now, the fact that his landlady appeared
to be slightly off her rocker didn’t worry
Billy in the least. After all, she was not
only harmless – there was no question
about that – but she was also quite
obviously a kind and generous soul. He
guessed that she had probably lost a son
in the war, or something like that, and had
never got over it.
 So a few minutes later, after unpacking his
suitcase and washing his hands, he trotted
downstairs to the ground floor and entered
260 the living-room. His landlady wasn’t there, but
the fire was glowing in the hearth, and the
little dachshund was still sleeping in front of it.
The room was wonderfully warm and cosy.
I’m a lucky fellow, he thought, rubbing his
hands. This is a bit of all right.
 He found the guest-book lying open on the
piano, so he took out his pen and wrote down
his name and address. There were only two
other entries above his on the page, and, as
one always does with guest-books, he started
to read them. One was a Christopher
Mulholland from Cardiff. The other was
Gregory W. Temple from Bristol. That’s
funny, he thought suddenly. Christopher
Mulholland. It rings a bell. Now where on
earth had he heard that rather unusual name
before?
 Was he a boy at school? No. Was it one of
his sister’s numerous young men, perhaps, or
280 a friend of his father’s? No, no, it wasn’t any
of those. He glanced down again at the book.
Christopher Mulholland, 231 Cathedral Road,
Cardiff. Gregory W. Temple, 27 Sycamore
Drive, Bristol. As a matter of fact, now he
came to think of it, he wasn’t at all sure that
the second name didn’t have almost as much
of a familiar ring about it as the first.
 “Gregory Temple?” he said aloud,
searching his memory. “Christopher
Mulholland? …”
 “Such charming boys,” a voice behind him
answered, and he turned and saw his
landlady sailing into the room with a large
silver tea-tray in her hands. She was holding
it well out in front of her, and rather high up,
as though the tray were a pair of reins on a
frisky horse.
 “They sound somehow familiar,” he said.
 “They do? How interesting.”
300 “I’m almost positive I’ve heard those names
before somewhere. Isn’t that queer? Maybe it
was in the newspapers. They weren’t famous
in any way, were they? I mean famous
cricketers or footballers or something like
that?”
 “Famous,” she said, setting the tea-tray
down on the low table in front of the sofa. “Oh 
no, I don’t think they were famous. But
they were extraordinarily handsome, both
of them, I can promise you that. They
were tall and young and handsome, my
dear, just exactly like you.”
Once more, Billy glanced down at the
book.
 “Look here,” he said, noticing the dates.
“This last entry is over two years old.”
 “It is?”
 “Yes, indeed. And Christopher
Mulholland’s is nearly a year before that –
320 more than three years ago.”
 “Dear me,” she said, shaking her head
and heaving a dainty little sigh. “I would
never have thought it. How time does fly
away from us all, doesn’t it, Mr Wilkins?”
 “It’s Weaver,” Billy said. “W-e-a-v-e-r.”
 “Oh, of course it is!” she cried, sitting
down on the sofa. “How silly of me. I do
apologise. In one ear and out the other,
that’s me, Mr Weaver.”
 “You know something?” Billy said.
‘Something that’s really quite
extraordinary about all this?”
 “No, dear, I don’t.”
 “Well, you see – both of these names,
Mulholland and Temple, I not only seem to
remember each one of them separately,
so to speak, but somehow or other, in
some peculiar way, they both appear to be
sort of connected together as well. As
340 though they were both famous for the
same sort of thing, if you see what I mean
– like … like Dempsey and Tunney, for
example, or Churchill and Roosevelt.”
 “How amusing,” she said. “But come
over here now, dear, and sit down beside
me on the sofa and I’ll give you a nice cup
of tea and a ginger biscuit before you go
to bed.”
 “You really shouldn’t bother,” Billy said.
“I didn’t mean you to do anything like that.”
He stood by the piano, watching her as
she fussed about with the cups and
saucers. He noticed that she had small,
white, quickly moving hands, and red
finger-nails.
 “I’m almost positive it was in the
newspapers I saw them,” Billy said. “I’ll
think of it in a second. I’m sure I will.”
 There is nothing more tantalising than a
360 thing like this which lingers just outside the
borders of one’s memory. He hated to give
up.
 “Now wait a minute,” he said. “Wait just a
minute. Mulholland ... Christopher Mulholland
... wasn’t that the name of the Eton schoolboy
who was on a walking-tour through the West
Country, and then all of a sudden ...”
 “Milk?” she said. “And sugar?”
 “Yes, please. And then all of a sudden ...”
 “Eton schoolboy?” she said. “Oh no, my
dear, that can’t possibly be right because my
Mr Mulholland was certainly not an Eton
schoolboy when he came to me. He was a
Cambridge undergraduate. Come over here
now and sit next to me and warm yourself in
front of this lovely fire. Come on. Your tea’s
all ready for you.” She patted the empty place
beside her on the sofa, and she sat there
smiling at Billy and waiting for him to come
380 over. He crossed the room slowly, and sat
down on the edge of the sofa. She placed his
teacup on the table in front of him.
 “There we are,” she said. “How nice and
cosy this is, isn’t it?”
 Billy started sipping his tea. She did the
same. For half a minute or so, neither of them
spoke. But Billy knew that she was looking at
him. Her body was half-turned towards him,
and he could feel her eyes resting on his
face, watching him over the rim of her teacup.
Now and again, he caught a whiff of a
peculiar smell that seemed to emanate
directly from her person. It was not in the
least unpleasant, and it reminded him – well,
he wasn’t quite sure what it reminded him of.
Pickled walnuts? New leather? Or was it the
corridors of a hospital?
 “Mr Mulholland was a great one for his tea,”
she said at length. “Never in my life have I
400 seen anyone drink as much tea as dear,
sweet Mr Mulholland.”
 “I suppose he left fairly recently,” Billy said.
He was still puzzling his head about the two
names.
He was positive now that he had seen them
in the newspapers – in the headlines.
 “Left?” she said, arching her brows. “But my
dear boy, he never left. He’s still here. Mr
Temple is also here. They’re on the third
floor, both of them together.”
 Billy set down his cup slowly on the table,
and stared at his landlady. She smiled back
at him, and then she put out one of her white 
hands and patted him comfortingly on the
knee. “How old are you, my dear?” she
asked.
 “Seventeen.”
 “Seventeen!” she cried. “Oh, it’s the
perfect age! Mr Mulholland was also
420 seventeen. But I think he was a trifle
shorter than you are, in fact I’m sure he
was, and his teeth weren’t quite so white.
You have the most beautiful teeth, Mr
Weaver, did you know that?”
 “They’re not as good as they look,” Billy
said.
 “They’ve got simply masses of fillings in
them at the back.”
 “Mr Temple, of course, was a little
older,” she said, ignoring his remark. “He
was actually twenty eight. And yet I never
would have guessed it if he hadn’t told
me, never in my whole life. There wasn’t a
blemish on his body.”
 “A what?” Billy said.
 “His skin was just like a baby’s.”
 There was a pause. Billy picked up his
teacup and took another sip of his tea,
then he set it down again gently in its
440 saucer. He waited for her to say
something else, but she seemed to have
lapsed into another of her silences. He sat
there staring straight ahead of him into the
far corner of the room, biting his lower lip.
 “That parrot,” he said at last. “You know
something? It had me completely fooled
when I first saw it through the window
from the street. I could have sworn it was
alive.”
 “Alas, no longer.”
 “It’s most terribly clever the way it’s been
done,” he said. “It doesn’t look in the least
bit dead. Who did it?”
 “I did.”
 “You did?”
 “Of course,” she said. “And have you
met my little Basil as well?” She nodded
towards the dachshund curled up so
comfortably in front of the fire. Billy looked
460 at it. And suddenly, he realised that this
animal had all the time been just as silent
and motionless as the parrot. He put out a
hand and touched it gently on the top of its
back. The back was hard and cold, and
when he pushed the hair to one side with
his fingers, he could see the skin
underneath, greyish-black and dry and
perfectly preserved.
 “Good gracious me,” he said. “How
absolutely fascinating.” He turned away from
the dog and stared with deep admiration at
the little woman beside him on the sofa. “It
must be most awfully difficult to do a thing
like that.”
 “Not in the least,” she said. “I stuff all my
little pets myself when they pass away. Will
you have another cup of tea?”
 “No, thank you,” Billy said. The tea tasted
faintly of bitter almonds, and he didn’t much
480 care for it.
 “You did sign the book, didn’t you?”
 “Oh, yes.”
 “That’s good. Because later on, if I happen
to forget what you were called, then I can
always come down here and look it up. I still
do that almost every day with Mr Mulholland
and Mr . . .Mr...”
 “Temple,” Billy said. “Gregory Temple.
Excuse my asking, but haven’t there been
any other guests here except them in the last
two or three years?”
 Holding her teacup high in one hand,
inclining her head slightly to the left, she
looked up at him out of the corners of her
eyes and gave him another gentle little smile.
 “No, my dear,” she said. ‘Only you.'


It was getting on toward six o'clock so I thought I'd buy myself a beer and go out and sit in a deck chair by the swimming pool and have a little evening sun.
I went to the bar and got the beer and carried it outside and wandered down the garden toward the pool.
It was a fine garden with lawns and beds of azaleas and tall coconut palms, and the wind was blowing strongly through the tops of the palm trees making the leaves hiss and crackle as though they were on fire. I could see the clusters of big brown nuts handing down underneath the leaves.
There were plenty of deck chairs around the swimming pool and there were white tables and huge brightly colored umbrellas and sunburned men and women sitting around in bathing suits. In the pool itself there were three or four girls and about a dozen boys, all splashing about and making a lot of noise and throwing a large rubber ball at one another.
I stood watching them. The girls were English girls from the hotel. The boys I didn't know about, but they sounded American and I thought they were probably naval cadets who'd come ashore from the U.S. naval training vessel which had arrived in the harbor that morning.
I went over and sat down under a yellow umbrella where there were four empty seats, and I poured my beer and settled back comfortably with a cigarette.
It was very pleasant sitting there in the sunshine with beer and a cigarette. It was pleasant to sit and watch the bathers splashing about in the green water.
The American sailors were getting on nicely with the English girls. They'd reached the stage where they were diving under the water and tipping them up by their legs.
Just then I noticed a small, oldish man walking briskly around the edge of the pool. He was immaculately dressed in a white suit and he walked very quickly with little bouncing strides, pushing himself high up onto his toes with each step. He had on a large creamy Panama hat, and he came bouncing along the side of the pool, looking at the people and the chairs.
He stopped beside me and smiled, showing two rows of very small, uneven teeth, slightly tarnished. I smiled back.
"Excuse pleess, but may I sit here?"
"Certainly," I said. "Go ahead."
He bobbed around to the back of the chair and inspected it for safety, then he sat down and crossed his legs. His white buckskin shows had little holes punched all over them for ventilation.
"A fine evening," he said. "They are all evenings fine here in Jamaica." I couldn't tell if the accent were Italian or Spanish, but I felt fairly sure he was some sort of a South American. And old too, when you saw him close. Probably around sixty-eight or seventy.
"Yes," I said. "It is wonderful here, isn't it."
"And who, might I ask are all dese? Dese is no hotel people." He was pointing at the bathers in the pool.
"I think they're American sailors," I told him. "They're Americans who are learning to be sailors."
"Of course dey are Americans. Who else in de world is going to make as much noise as dat? You are not American, no?"
"No," I said. "I am not."
Suddenly one of the American cadets was standing in front of us. He was dripping wet from the pool and one of the English girls was standing there with him.
"Are these chairs taken?" he said.
"No," I answered.
"Mind if I sit down?"
"Go ahead."
"Thanks," he said. He had a towel in his hand and when he sat down he unrolled it and produced a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He offered the cigarettes to the girl and she refused; then he offered them to me and I took one. The little man said, "Tank you, no, but I tink I have a cigar." He pulled out a crocodile case and got himself a cigar, then he produced a knife which had a small scissors in it and he snipped the end off the cigar.
"Here, let me give you a light." The American boy held up his lighter.
"Dat will not work in dis wind."
"Sure, it'll work. It always works."
The little man removed his unlighted cigar from his mouth, cocked his head on one side and looked at the boy.
"All-ways?" he said softly.
"Sure, it never fails. Not with me anyway."
The little man's head was still cocked over on one side and he was still watching the boy. "Well, well. So you say dis famous lighter it never fails. Iss dat you say?"
"Sure," the boy said. "That's right." He was about nineteen or twenty with a long freckled face and a rather sharp birdlike nose. His chest was not very sunburned and there were freckles there too, and a few wisps of pale-reddish hair. He was holding the lighter in his right hand, ready to flip the wheel. "It never fails," he said, smiling now because he was purposely exaggerating his little boast. "I promise you it never fails."
"One momint, pleess." The hand that held the cigar came up high, palm outward, as though it were stopping traffic. "Now juss one momint." He had a curiously soft, toneless voice and he kept looking at the boy all the time.
"Shall we not perhaps make a little bet on dat?" He smiled at the boy. "Shall we not make a little bet on whether your lighter lights?"
"Sure, I'll bet," the boy said. "Why not?"
"You like to bet?"
"Sure, I'll always bet."
The man paused and examined his cigar, and I must say I didn't much like the way he was behaving. It seemed he was already trying to make something out of this, and to embarrass the boy, and at the same time I had the feeling he was relishing a private little secret all his own.
He looked up again at the boy and said slowly, "I like to bet, too. Why we don't have a good bet on dis ting? A good big bet?
"Now wait a minute," the boy said. "I can't do that. But I'll bet you a dollar, or whatever it is over here-some shillings, I guess."
The little man waved his hand again. "Listen to me. Now we have some fun. We make a bet. Den we go up to my room here in de hotel where iss no wind and I bet you you cannot light dis famous lighter of yours ten times running without missing once."
"I'll bet I can," the boy said.
"All right. Good. We make a bet, yes?"
"Sure. I'll bet you a buck."
"No, no. I make you very good bet. I am rich man and I am sporting man also. Listen to me. Outside de hotel iss my car. Iss very fine car. American car from your country. Cadillac-"
"Hey, now. Wait a minute." The boy leaned back in his deck chair and he laughed. "I can't put up that sort of property. This is crazy."
"Not crazy at all. You strike lighter successfully ten times running and Cadillac is yours. You like to have dis Cadillac, yes?"
"Sure, I'd like to have a Cadillac." The boy was still grinning.
"All right. Fine. We make a bet and I put up my Cadillac."
"And what do I put up?"
"The little man carefully removed the red band from his still unlighted cigar. "I never ask you, my friend, to bet something you cannot afford. You understand?"
"Then what do I bet?"
"I make it very easy for you, yes?"
"Okay. You make it easy."
"Some small ting you can afford to give away, and if you did happen to lose it you would not feel too bad. Right?"
"Such as what?"
"Such as, perhaps, de little finger of your left hand."
"My what! The boy stopped grinning.
"Yes. Why not? You win, you take de car. You looss, I take de finger."
"I don't get it. How d'you mean, you take the finger?"
"I chop it off."
"Jumping jeepers! That's a crazy bet. I think I'll just make it a dollar."
The man leaned back, spread out his hands palms upward and gave a tiny contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. "Well, well, well," he said. "I do not understand. You say it lights but you will not bet. Den we forget it, yes?"
The boy sat quite still, staring at the bathers in the pool. Then he remembered suddenly he hadn't lighted his cigarette. He put it between his lips, cupped his hands around the lighter and flipped the wheel. The wick lighted and burned with a small, steady, yellow flame and the way he held his hands the wind didn't get to it at all.
"Could I have a light, too?" I said.
"Gee, I'm sorry. I forgot you didn't have one."
I held out my hand for the lighter, but he stood up and came over to do it for me.
"Thank you," I said, and he returned to his seat.
"You having a good time?" I asked.
"Fine," he answered. "It's pretty nice here."
There was a silence then, and I could see that the little man has succeeded in disturbing the boy with his absurd proposal. He was sitting there very still, and it was obvious that a small tension was beginning to build up inside him. Then he started shifting about in his seat, and rubbing his chest, and stroking the back of his neck, and finally he placed both hands on his knees and began tapping his fingers against his knee-caps. Soon he was tapping with one of his feet as well.
"Now just let me check up on this bet of yours," he said at last. "You say we go up to your room and if I make this lighter light ten times running I win a Cadillac. If it misses just once then I forfeit the little finger of my left hand. Is that right?"
"Certainly. Dat is de bet. But I tink you are afraid."
"What do we do if I lose? Do I have to hold my finger out while you chop it off?"
"Oh, no! Dat would be no good. And you might be tempted to refuse to hold it out. What I should do I should tie one of your hands to de table before we started and I should stand dere with a knife ready to go chop de momint your lighter missed."
"What year is the Cadillac?" the boy asked.
"Excuse. I not understand."
"What year-how old is the Cadillac?"
"Ah! How old? Yes. It is last year. Quite now car. But I see you are not betting man. Americans never are."
The boy paused for just a moment and he glanced first at the English girl, then at me. "Yes," he said sharply. "I'll bet you."
"Good!" The little man clapped his hands together quietly, once. "Fine," he said. "We do it now. And you, sir," he turned to me, "you would perhaps be good enough to, what you call it, to-to referee." He had pale, almost colorless eyes with tiny bright black pupils.
"Well," I said. "I think it's a crazy bet. I don't think I like it very much."
"Nor do I," said the English girl. It was the first time she'd spoken. "I think it's a stupid, ridiculous bet."
"Are you serious about cutting off this boy's finger if he loses?" I said.
"Certainly I am. Also about cutting off this boy's finger if he loses?" I said.
"Certainly I am. Also about giving him Cadillac if he win. Come now. We go to my room."
He stood up. "You like to put on some clothes first?" he said.
"No," the boy answered. "I'll come like this." Then he turned to me. "I'd consider it a favor if you'd come along and referee."
"All right," I said. "I'll come along, but I don't like the bet."
"You come too," he said to the girl. "You come and watch.
The little man led the way back through the garden to the hotel. He was animated now, and excited, and that seemed to make him bounce up higher than ever on his toes as he walked along.
"I live in annex," he said. "You like to see car first? Iss just here."
He took us to where we could see the front driveway of the hotel and he stopped and pointed to a sleek pale-green Cadillac parked close by.
"Dere she iss. De green one. You like?"
"Say, that's a nice car," the boy said.
"All right. Now we go up and see if you can win her."
We followed him into the annex and up one flight of stairs. He unlocked his door and we all trooped into what was a large pleasant double bedroom. There was a woman's dressing gown lying across the bottom of one of the beds.
"First," he said, "we'ave a little Martini."
The drinks were on a small table in the far corner, all ready to be mixed, and there was a shaker and ice and plenty of glasses. He began to make the Martini, but meanwhile he'd rung the bell and now there was a knock on the door and a colored maid came in.
"Ah!" he said, putting down the bottle of gin, taking a wallet from his pocket and pulling out a pound note. "You will do something for me now, pleess." He gave the maid the pound.
"You keep dat," he said. "And now we are going to play a little game in here and I want you to go off and find for me two-no three tings. I want some nails; I want a hammer, and I want a chopping knife, a butcher's chipping knife which you can borrow from de kitchen. You can get, yes?"
"A chopping knife!" The maid opened her eyes wide and clasped her hands in front of her. "You mean a real chopping knife?"
"Yes, yes, of course. Come on now, pleess. You can find dose tings surely for me."
"Yes, sir, I'll try, sir. Surely I'll try to get them." And she went.
The little man handed round the Martinis. We stood there and sipped them, the boy with the long freckled face and the pointed nose, bare-bodied except for a pair of faded brown bathing shorts; the English girl, a large-boned, fair-haired girl wearing a pale blue bathing suit, who watched the boy over the top of her glass all the time; the little man with the colorless eyes standing there in his immaculate white suit drinking his Martini and looking at the girl in her pale blue bathing dress. I didn't know what to make of it all. The man seemed serious about the bet and he seemed serious about the business of cutting off the finger. But hell, what if the boy lost? Then we'd have to rush him to the hospital in the Cadillac that he hadn't won. That would be a fine thing. Now wouldn't that be a really find thing? It would be a damn silly unnecessary thing so far as I could see.
"Don't you think this is rather a silly bet?" I said.
"I think it's a fine bet," the boy answered. He had already downed one large Martini.
"I think it's a stupid, ridiculous bet," the girl said. "What'll happen if you lose?"
"It won't matter. Come to think of it, I can't remember ever in my life having had any use for the little finger on my left hand. Here he is." The boy took hold of the finger. "Here he is and he hasn't ever done a thing for me yet. So why shouldn't I bet him. I think it's a fine bet."
The little man smiled and picked up the shaker and refilled our glasses.
"Before we begin," he said, "I will present to de-to de referee de key of de car." He produced a car key from his pocket and gave it to me. "De papers," he said, "de owning papers and insurance are in de pocket of de car."
Then the colored maid came in again. In one hand she carried a small chopper, the kind used by butchers for chopping meat bones, and in the other a hammer and a bag of nails.
"Good! You get dem all. Tank you, tank you. Now you can go." He waited until the maid had closed the door, then he put the implements on one of the beds and said, "Now we prepare ourselves, yes?" And to the boy "Help me, pleess, with dis table. We carry it out a little."
It was the usual kind of hotel writing desk, just a plain rectangular table about four feet by three with a blotting pad, ink, pens and paper. They carried it out into the room away from the wall, and removed the writing things.
"And now," he said, "a chair." He picked up a chair and placed it beside the table. He was very brisk and very animated, like a person organizing games at a children's party. "And now de nails. I must put in de nails." He fetched the nails and he began to hammer them into the top of the table.
We stood there, the boy, the girl, and I, holding Martinis in out hands, watching the little man at work. We watched him hammer two nails into the table, about six inches apart. He didn't hammer them right home; he allowed a small part of each one to stick up. Then he tested them for firmness with his fingers.
Anyone would think the son of a bitch had done this before, I told myself. He never hesitates. Table, nails, hammer, kitchen chopper. He knows exactly what he needs and how to arrange it.
"And now," he said, "all we want is some string." He found some string. "All right, at last we are ready. Will you pleess to sit here at de table," he said to the boy.
The boy put his glass away and sat down.
"Now place de left hand between dese two nails. De nails are only so I can tie your hand in place. All right, good. Now I tie your hand secure to de table-so,"
He wound the string around the boy's wrist, then several times around the wide part of the hand, then he fastened it tight to the nails. He made a good job of it and when he'd finished there wasn't any question about the boy being able to draw his hand away. But he could move his fingers.
"Now pleess, clench de fist, all except for de little finger. You must leave de little finger sticking out, lying on de table."
"Ex-cellent! Ex-cellent! Now we are ready. Wid your right hand you manipulate de lighter. But one momint, pleess."
He skipped over to the bed and picked up the chopper. He came back and stood beside the table with the chopper in his hand.
"We are all ready?" he said. "Mister referee, you must say to begin."
The English girl was standing there in her pale blue bathing costume right behind the boy's chair. She was just standing there, not saying anything. The boy was sitting quite still, holding the lighter in his right hand, looking at the chopper. The little man was looking at me.
"Are you ready?" I asked the boy.
"I'm ready."
"And you?" to the little man.
"Quite ready," he said and he lifted the chopper up in the air and held it there about two feet above the boy's finger, ready to chop. The boy watched it, but he didn't flinch and his mouth didn't move at all. He merely raised his eyebrows and frowned.
"All right," I said. "Go ahead."
The boy said, "Will you please count aloud the number of times I light it."
"Yes," I said. "I'll do that."
With his thumb he raised the top of the lighter, and again with the thumb he gave the wheel a sharp flick. The flint sparked and the wick caught fire and burned with a small yellow flame.
"One!" I called.
He didn't blow the flame out; he closed the top of the lighter on it and he waited for perhaps five seconds before opening it again.
He flicked the wheel very strongly and once more there was a small flame burning on the wick.
"Two!"
No one else said anything. The boy kept his eyes on the lighter. The little man held the chipper up in the air and he too was watching the lighter.
"Three!"
"Four!"
"Five!"
"Six!"
"Seven!" Obviously it was one of those lighters that worked. The fling gave a big spark and the wick was the right length. I watched the thumb snapping the top down onto the flame. Then a pause. Then the thumb raising the top once more. This was an all-thumb operation. The thumb did everything. I took a breath, ready to say eight. The thumb flicked the wheel. The flint sparked. The little flame appeared.
"Eight!" I said, and as I said it the door opened. We all turned and we saw a woman standing in the doorway, a small, black-haired woman, rather old, who stood there for about two seconds then rushed forward shouting, "Carlos! Carlos!" She grabbed his wrist, took the chopper from him, threw it on the bed, took hold of the little man by the lapels of his white suit and began shaking him very vigorously, talking to him fast and loud and fiercely all the time in some Spanish-sounding language. She shook him so fast you couldn't see him any more. He became a faint, misty, quickly moving outline, like the spokes of a turning wheel.
Then she slowed down and the little man came into view again and she hauled him across the room and pushed him backward onto one of the beds. He sat on the edge of it blinking his eyes and testing his head to see if it would still turn on his neck.
"I am so sorry," the woman said. "I am so terribly sorry that this should happen." She spoke almost perfect English.
"It is too bad," she went on. "I suppose it is really my fault. For ten minutes I leave him alone to go and have my hair washed and I come back and he is at it again." She looked sorry and deeply concerned.
The boy was untying his hand from the table. The English girl and I stood there and said nothing.
"He is a menace," the woman said. "Down where we live at home he has taken altogether forty-seven fingers from different people, and he has lost eleven cars. In the end they threatened to have him put away somewhere. That's why I brought him up here."
"We were only having a little bet," mumbled the little man from the bed.
"I suppose he bet you a car," the woman said.
"Yes," the boy answered. "A Cadillac."
"He has no car. It's mine. And that makes it worse," she said, "that he should bet you when he has nothing to bet with. I am ashamed and very sorry about it all." She seemed an awfully nice woman.
"Well," I said, "then here's the key of your car." I put it on the table.
"We were only having a little bet," mumbled the little man.
"He hasn't anything left to bet with," the woman said. "He hasn't a thing in the world. Not a thing. As a matter of fact I myself won it all from him a long while ago. It took time, a lot of time, and it was hard work, but I won it all in the end." She looked up at the boy and she smiled, a slow sad smile, and she came over and put out a hand to take the key from the table.
I can see it now, that hand of hers; it had only one finger on it, and a thumb.


The Great Automatic Grammatizator
by Roald Dahl

“Well, Knipe, my boy. Now that it’s finished, I just called you in to tell you I think you’ve done a fine job.”

Adolph Knipe stood still in front of Mr Bohlen’s desk. There seemed to be no enthusiasm in him at all.

“Aren’t you pleased?”

“Oh yes, Mr Bohlen.”

“Did you see what the papers said this morning?”

“No, sir, I didn’t.”

The man behind the desk pulled a folded newspaper towards him, and began to read:” The building of the great automatic computing engine, ordered by the government some time ago, is now complete. It is probably the fastest electronic calculating machine in the world today. Its function is to satisfy the ever-increasing need of science, industry, and administration for rapid mathematical calculation which, in the past, by traditional methods, would have been physically impossible, or would have required more time than the problems justified. The speed with which the new engine works, said Mr John Bohlen, head of the firm of electrical engineers mainly responsible for its construction, may be grasped by the fact that it can provide the correct answer in five seconds to a problem that would occupy a mathematician for a month. In three minutes, it can produce a calculation that by hand (if it were possible) would fill half a million sheets of foolscap paper. The automatic computing engine uses pulses of electricity at the rate of a million a second to solve all calculations that resolve themselves into addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For practical purposes there is no limit to what it can do…”

Mr Bohlen glanced up at the long, melancholy face of the younger man. “Aren’t you proud, Knipe? Aren’t you pleased?”

“Of course, Mr Bohlen.”

“I don’t think I have to remind you that your own contribution, especially to the original plans, was an important one. In fact, I might go so far as to say that without you and some of your ideas, this project might still be on the drawing-boards today.”

Adolph Knipe moved his feet on the carpet, and he watched the two small white hands of his chief, the nervous fingers paying with a paperclip, unbending it, straightening out the hairpin curves. He didn’t like the man’s hands. He didn’t like his face either, with the tiny mouth and the narrow purplecoloured lips. It was unpleasant the way only the lower lip moved when he talked.

“Is anything bothering you, Knipe? Anything on your mind?”

“Oh no, Mr Bohlen. No.”

“How would you like to take a week’s holiday? Do you good. You’ve earned it.”

“Oh, I don’t know, sir.”

The older man waited, watching this tall, thin person who stood so sloppily before him. He was a difficult boy. Why couldn’t he stand up straight? Always drooping and untidy, with spots on his jacket, and hair falling all over his face.

“I’d like you to take a holiday, Knipe. You need it.”

“All right, sir. If you wish.”

“Take a week. Two weeks if you like. Go somewhere warm. Get some sunshine. Swim. Relax. Sleep. Then come back, and we’ll have another talk about the future.”



Adolph Knipe went home by bus to his two-room apartment. He threw his coat on the sofa, poured himself a drink of whisky, and sat down in front of the typewriter that was on the table. Mr Bohlen was right. Of course he was right. Except that he didn’t know half of it. He probably thought it was a woman. Whenever a young man gets depressed, everybody thinks it’s a woman.

He leaned forward and began to read through the half-finished sheet of typing still in the machine. It was headed “A Narrow Escape”, and it began “The night was dark and stormy, the wind whistled in the trees, the rain poured down like cats and dogs…”

Adolph Knipe took a sip of whisky, tasting the malty-bitter flavour, feeling the trickle of cold liquid as it travelled down his throat and settled in the top of his stomach, cool at first, then spreading and becoming warm, making a little area of warmness in the gut. To hell with Mr John Bohlen anyway. And to hell with the great electrical computing machine. To hell with …

At exactly that moment, his eyes and mouth began slowly to open, in a sort of wonder, and slowly he raised his head and became still, absolutely motionless, gazing at the wall opposite with this look that was more perhaps of astonishment than of wonder, but quite fixed now, unmoving, and remaining thus for forty, fifty, sixty seconds. Then gradually (the head still motionless), a subtle change spreading over the face, astonishment becoming pleasure, very slight at first, only around the corners of the mouth, increasing gradually, spreading out until at last the whole face was open wide and shining with extreme delight. It was the first time Adolph Knipe had smiled in many, many months.

“Of course,” he said, speaking aloud, “it’s completely ridiculous.” Again he smiled, raising his upper lip and baring his teeth in a queerly sensual manner.

”It’s a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn’t really bear thinking about at all.”

From then on, Adolph Knipe began to think about nothing else. The idea fascinated him enormously, at first because it gave him a promise – however remote – of revenging himself in a most devilish manner upon his greatest enemies. From this angle alone, he toyed idly with it for perhaps ten or fifteen minutes; then all at once he found himself examining it quite seriously as a practical possibility. He took paper and made some preliminary notes. But he didn’t get far. He found himself, almost immediately up against the old truth that a machine, however ingenious, is incapable of original thought. It can handle no problems except those that resolve themselves into mathematical terms – problems that contain one, and only one, correct answer.

This was a stumper. There didn’t seem any way around it. A machine cannot have a brain. On the other hand, it can have a memory, can it not? Their own electronic calculator had a marvelous memory. Simply by converting electric pulses, through a column of mercury, into supersonic waves, it could store away at least a thousand numbers at a time, extracting any one of them at the precise moment it was needed. Would it not be possible, therefore, on this principle, to build a memory section of almost unlimited size?

Now what about that?

Then suddenly, he was struck by a powerful but simple little truth, and it was this: that English grammar is governed by rules that are almost mathematical in their strictness! Given the words, and given the sense of what is to be said, then there is only one correct order in which those words can be arranged.

No, he thought, that isn’t quite accurate. In many sentences there are several alternative positions for words and phrases, all of which may be grammatically correct. But what the hell. The theory itself is basically true. Therefore, it stands to reason that an engine built along the lines of the electric computer could be adjusted to arrange words (instead of numbers) in their right order according to the rules of grammar. Give it the verbs, the nouns, the adjectives, the pronouns, store them in the memory section as a vocabulary, and arrange for them to be extracted as required. Then feed it with plots and leave it to write the sentences.

There was no stopping Knipe now. He went to work immediately, and there followed during the next few days a period of intense labour. The living-room became littered with sheets of paper; formulae and calculations; lists of words, thousands and thousands of words; the plots of stories, curiously broken up and subdivided; huge extracts from Roget’s Thesaurus; pages filled with the first names of men and women; hundreds of surnames taken from the telephone directory; intricate drawings of wires and circuits and switches and thermionic valves; drawings of machines that could punch holes of different shapes in little cards, and of a strange electric typewriter that could type ten thousand words a minute. Also a kind of control panel with a series of small push-buttons, each one labeled with the name of a famous American magazine.

He was working in a mood of exultation, prowling around the room amidst this littering of paper, rubbing his hands together, talking out loud to himself; and sometimes, with a sly curl of the nose he would mutter a series of murderous imprecations in which the word “editor” seemed always to be present. On the fifteenth day of continuous work, he collected the papers into two large folders which he carried – almost at a run – to the officers of John Bohlen Inc., electrical engineers.

Mr Bohlen was pleased to see him back.

“Well, Knipe, good gracious me, you look a hundred per cent better. You have a good holiday? Where’d you go?”

He’s just as ugly and untidy as ever, Mr Bohlen thought. Why doesn’t he stand up straight? He looks like a bent stick. “You look a hundred per cent better, my boy.” I wonder what he’s grinning about. Every time I see him, his ears seem to have got larger.

Adolph Knipe placed the folders on the desk. “Look, Mr Bohlen!” he cried. “Look at these!”

Then he poured out his story. He opened the folders and pushed the plans in front of the astonished little man. He talked for over an hour, explaining everything, and when he had finished, he stepped back, breathless, flushed, waiting for the verdict.

“You know what I think, Knipe? I think you’re nuts.” Careful now, Mr Bohlen told himself. Treat him carefully. He’s valuable, this one is. If only he didn’t look so awful, with that long horse face and the big teeth. The fellow had ears as big as rhubarb leaves.

“But Mr Bohlen! It’ll work! I’ve proved to you it’ll work! You can’t deny that!”

“Take it easy now, Knipe. Take it easy and listen to me.”

Adolph Knipe watched this man, disliking him more every second.

“This idea,” Mr Bohlen’s lower lip was saying, “is very ingenious – I might say almost brilliant – and it only goes to confirm my opinion of your abilities, Knipe. But don’t take it too seriously. After all, my boy, what possible use can it be to us? Who on earth wants a machine for writing stories? And where’s the money in it anyway? Just tell me that.”

“May I sit down, sir?”

“Sure, take a seat.”

Adolph Knipe seated himself on the edge of a chair. The older man watched him with alert brown eyes, wondering what was coming now.

“I would like to explain something Mr Bohlen, if I may, about how I came to do all this.”

“Go right ahead, Knipe.” He would have to be humoured a little now, Mr Bohlen told himself. The boy was really valuable – a sort of genius, almost – worth his weight in gold to the firm. Just look at these papers here. Darndest thing ever saw. Astonishing piece of work. Quite useless, of course. No commercial value. But it proved again the boy’s ability.

“It’s a sort of confession, I suppose, Mr Bohlen. I think it explains why I’ve always been so …so kind of worried.”

“You tell me anything you want, Knipe. I’m here to help you – you know that.”

The young man clasped his hands together tight on his lap, hugging himself with his elbows. It seemed as though suddenly he was feeling very cold.

“You see, Mr Bohlen, to tell the honest truth, I don’t really care much for my work here. I know I’m good at it and all that sort of thing, but my heart’s not in it. It’s not what I want to do most.”

Up went Mr Bohlen’s eyebrows, quick like a spring. His whole body became very still.

“You see, sir, all my life I’ve wanted to be a writer.”

“A writer!”

“Yes, Mr Bohlen. You may not believe it, but every bit of spare time I’ve had, I’ve spent writing stories. In the last ten years I’ve written hundreds, literally hundreds of short stories. Five hundred and sixty-six, to be precise. Approximately one a week.”

“Good heavens. Man! What on earth did you do that for?”

“All I know, sir, is I have the urge.”

“What sort of urge?”

“The creative urge, Mr Bohlen.” Every time he looked up he saw Mr Bohlen’s lips. They were growing thinner and thinner, more and more purple.

“And may I ask you what you do with these stories, Knipe?”

“Well, sir, that’s the trouble. No one will buy them. Each time I finish one, I send it out on the rounds. It goes to one magazine after another. That’s all that happens, Mr Bohlen, and they simply send them back. It’s very depressing.”

Mr Bohlen relaxed. “I can see quite well how you feel, my boy.” His voice was dripping with sympathy. “We all go through it one time or another in our lives. But now – now that you’ve had proof – positive proof – from the experts themselves, from the editors, that your stories are – what shall I say – rather unsuccessful, it’s time to leave off. Forget it, my boy. Just forget all about it.”

“No, Mr Bohlen! No! That’s not true! I know my stories are good. My heavens, when you compare them with the stuff some of those magazines print – oh my word, Mr Bohlen! – the sloppy, boring stuff that you see in the magazines week after week – why, it drives me mad!”

“Now, wait a minute, my boy…”

“Do you ever read the magazines, Mr Bohlen?”

“You’ll pardon me, Knipe, but what’s all this got to do with your machine?”

“Everything, Mr Bohlen, absolutely everything! What I want to tell you is, I’ve made a study of magazines, and it seems that each one tends to have its own particular type of story. The writers – the successful ones – know this, and they write accordingly.”

“Just a minute, my boy. Calm yourself down, will you. I don’t think all this is getting us anywhere.”

“Please, Mr Bohlen, hear me through. It’s all terribly important.” He paused to catch his breath. He was properly worked up now, throwing his hands around as he talked. The long, toothy face, with the big ears on either side, simply shone with enthusiasm, and there was an excess of saliva in his mouth which caused him to speak his words wet. “So you see, on my machine, by having an adjustable co-ordinator between the “plot-memory” section and the “word-memory” section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button.”

“Yes, I know, Knipe, This is all very interesting, but what’s the point of it?”

“Just this, Mr Bohlen. The market is limited. We’ve got to be able to produce the right stuff, at the right time, whenever we want it. It’s a matter of business, that’s all. I’m looking at it from your point of view now – as a commercial proposition.”

“My dear boy, it can’t possibly be a commercial proposition – ever. You know as well as I do what it costs to build one of these machines.”

“Yes, sir, I do. But with due respect, I don’t believe you know what the magazines pay writers for stories.”

“What do they pay?”

“Anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars. It probably averages around a thousand.”

Mr Bohlen jumped.

“Yes sir, it is true.”

“Absolutely impossible, Knipe! Ridiculous!”

“No sir, it is true.”

“You mean to sit there and tell me that these magazines pay out money like that to a man for …just for scribbling off a story! Good heavens, Knipe! Whatever next! Writers must all be millionaires!”

“That’s exactly it, Mr Bohlen! That’s where the machine comes in. Listen a minute, sir, while I tell you some more. I’ve got it all worked out. The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That’s forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we can collar nearly the whole of this market!”

“My dear boy, you are mad!”

“No sir, honestly, it’s true what I say. Don’t you see that with volume alone we’ll completely overwhelm them! This machine can produce a five-thousand word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. How can the writers compete with that? I ask you, Mr Bohen, how?”

At that point, Adolph Knipe noticed a slight change in the man’s expression, an extra brightness in the eyes, the nostrils distending, the whole face becoming still, almost rigid. Quickly, he continued.

“Nowadays, Mr Bohlen, the hand-made article hasn’t a hope. It can’t possibly compete with mass-production., especially in this country – you know that. Carpets…chairs…shoes…bricks…crockery…anything you like to mention - they are all made by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn’t matter. It’s the cost of production that counts. And stories – well - they are just another product, like carpets and chairs, and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goods. We’ll sell them wholesale, Mr Bohlen! We’ll undercut every writer in the country! We’ll corner the market!”

Mr Bohlen edged up straighter in the chair. He was leaning forward now, both elbows on the desk, the face alert, the small brown eyes on the speaker.

“I sill think it’s impracticable, Knipe.”

“Forty thousand a week!” cried Knipe. “And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that’s still a million a year!” And softly added. “You didn’t get any million a year for building the old electronic calculator, did you, Mr Bohlen?”

“But seriously now, Knipe. D’you really think they’d buy them?”

“Listen, Mr Bohlen. Who on earth is going to want custom-made stories when they can get the other kind at half the price? It stands to reason, doesn’t it?”

“And how will you sell them? Who will you say has written them?”

“We’ll set up our own literary agency, and we’ll distribute them through that. And we’ll invent all the names we want for the writers.”

“I don’t like it, Knipe. To me, that smacks of trickery, does it not?”

“And another thing, Mr Bohlen. There’s all manner of valuable by-products once you’ve got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products. Why, my heavens, Mr Bohlen! This isn’t any children’s playing we’re talking about. It’s big business.”

“Don’t get too ambitious, my boy.”

“And another thing. There isn’t any reason why we shouldn’t put your name, Mr Bohlen, on some of the better stories, if you wished it.”

“My goodness, Knipe. What should I want that for?”

“I don’t know, sir, except that some writers get to be very much respected – like Mr Erle Gardner or Kathleen Morris, for example. We’ve got to have names, and I was certainly thinking of using my own on one or two stories, just to help out.”

“A writer, eh?” Mr Bohlen said, musing. “Well, it would surely surprise them over at the club when they saw my name in the magazines – the good magazines.”

“That’s right, Mr Bohlen.”

For a moment, a dreamy, faraway look came into Mr Bohlen’s eyes, and he smiled. Then he stirred himself and began leafing through the plans that lay before him.”

“One thing I don’t quite understand, Knipe. Where do the plots come from? The machine can’t possibly invent plots.”

“We feed those in, sir. That’s no problem at all. Everyone has plots. There’s three of four hundred of them written down in that folder there on your left. Feed them straight into the “plot memory” section of the machine.”

“Go on.”

“There are many other little refinements, too, Mr Bohlen. You’ll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there’s a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the writer is wise and clever. So I have the machine do the same thing. There’ll be a whole stack of long words stored away just for this purpose.”

“Where?”

“In the “word-memory” section,” he said, epexegetically.

Through most of that day the two men discussed the possibilities of the new engine. In the end, Mr Bohlen said he would have to think about it some more. The next morning, he was quietly enthusiastic. Within a week, he was completely sold on the idea.

“What we’ll have to do, Knipe, is to say that we are merely building another mathematical calculator, but of a new type. That’ll keep the secret.”

“Exactly. Mr Bohlen.”

And in six months the machine was completed. It was housed in a separate brick building at the back of the premises, and now that it was ready for action, no one was allowed near it excepting Mr Bohlen and Adolph Knipe.

It was an exciting moment when the two men – the one, short, plump, breviped – the other tall, thin and toothy – stood in the corridor before the control panel and got ready to run off the first story. All around them were walls dividing up into many small corridors and the walls were covered with wiring and plugs and switches and huge glass valves. They were both nervous, Mr Bohlen hopping from one foot to the other, quite unable to keep still.

“Which button?” Adolph Knipe asked, eyeing a row of small white discs that resembled the keys of a typewriter. “You choose, Mr Bohlen. Lots of magazines to pick from – Saturday Evening Post, Collier’s, Ladies’ Home Journal – any one you like.”

“Goodness me, boy! How do I know?” He was jumping down like a man with hives.

“Mr Bohlen,” Adolph Knipe said gravely, “do you realize that at this moment, with your little finger alone, you have it in your power to become the most versatile writer on this continent?”

“Listen, Knipe, just get on with it, will you please and cut out the preliminaries.”

“Okay, Mr Bohlen. Then we’ll make it … let me see – this one. How’s that? He extended one finger and pressed down a button with the name TODAY’S WOMAN printed across it in diminutive black type. There was a sharp click, and when he took his finger away, the button remained down, below the level of the others.

“So much for the selection,” he said. “Now – here we go!” He reached up and pulled a switch on the panel. Immediately, the room was filled with a loud humming noise, and a cracking of electric sparks, and the jingle of many, tiny, quickly-moving levers: and almost in the same instant, sheets of quarto paper began sliding out from a slot to the right of the control panel and dropping into a basket below. They came out quick, one sheet a second, and in less than half a minute it was all over. The sheets stopped coming.

“That’s it!” Adolph Knipe cried. “There’s your story!”

They grabbed the sheets and began to read. The first one they picked up started as follows:” fhgur,ncds,afkjffhtymdfn,akj,djwkhfgrth,e,vmaelLKDUERB…” They looked at the others. The style was roughly similar in all of them. Mr Bohlen began to shout. The younger man tried to calm him down.

“It’s all right, sir. Really it is. It only needs a little adjustment. We’ve got a connection wrong somewhere, that’s all. You must remember, Mr Bohlen, there’s over a million feet of writing in this room. You can’t expect everything to be right first time.”

“It’ll never work,” Mr Bohlen said.

“Be patient, sir. Be patient.”

Adolph Knipe set out to discover the fault, and in four days’ time he announced that all was ready for the next try.

“It’ll never work,” Mr Bohlen said. “I know it’ll never work.” Knipe smiled and pressed the selector button marked Reader’s Digest. Then he pulled the switch, and again the strange, exciting, humming sound filled the room. One page of typescript flew out of the slot into the basket.

“Where’s the rest?” Mr Bohlen cried. “It’s stopped! It’s gone wrong!”

“No, sir, it hasn’t. It’s exactly right. It’s for the Digest, don’t you see?”

This time it began:

“Fewpeopleyetknowthatarevolutionarynewcurehsabeendiscoveredwhichmaywellbringpermanentrelieftosuferersofthemostdreadeddiseaseofourtime…” And so on.

“It’s gibberish!” Mr Bohlen shouted.

“No, sir, it’s fine. Can’t you see? It’s simply that she’s not breaking up the words. That’s an easy adjustment. But the story’s there. Look, Mr Bohlen, look! It’s all there except that the words are joined together.”

And indeed it was.

On the next try a few days later, everything was perfect, even the punctuation. The first story they ran off, for a famous women’s magazine, was a solid, plotty story of a boy who wanted to better himself with his rich employer. This boy arranged, so that story went, for a friend to hold up the rich man’s daughter on a dark night when she was driving home. Then the boy himself, happening by, knocked the gun out of his friend’s hand and rescued the girl. The girl was grateful. But the father was suspicious. He questioned the boy sharply. The boy broke down and confessed. Then the father, instead of kicking him out of the house, said that he admired the boy’s resourcefulness. The girl admired his honesty – and his looks. The father promised him to be head of the Accounts Department. The girl married him.

“It’s tremendous, Mr Bohlen! It’s exactly right!”

“Seems a bit sloppy to me, my boy!”

“No, sir, it’s a seller, a real seller!”

In his excitement, Adolph Knipe promptly ran off six more stories in as many minutes. All of them – except one, which for some reason came out a trifle lewd – seemed entirely satisfactory.

Mr Bohlen was now mollified. He agreed to set up a literary agency in an office downtown, and to put Knipe in charge. In a couple of weeks, this was accomplished. Then Knipe mailed out the first dozen stories. He put his own name to four of them, Mr Bohlen’s to one, and for the others he simply invented names.

Five of these stories were promptly accepted. The one with Mr Bohlen’s name on it was turned down with a letter from the fiction editor saying. “This is a skillful job, but in our opinion it doesn’t quite come off. We would like to see more of this writer’s work…” Adolph Knipe took a cab to the factory and ran off another story for the same magazine. He again put Mr Bohlen’s name to it, and mailed it immediately. That one they bought.

The money started pouring in. Knipe slowly and carefully stepped up the output, and in six months’ time he was delivering thirty stories a week, and selling about half.

He began to make a name for himself in literary circles as a prolific and successful writer. So did Mr Bohlen; but not quite such a good name, although he didn’t know it. At the same time, Knipe was building up a dozen or more fictitious persons as promising young writers. Everything was going fine.

At this point it was decided to adapt the machine for writing novels as well as stories. Mr Bohlen, thirsting now for greater honours in the literary world, insisted that Knipe go to work at once on this prodigious task.

“I want to do a novel,” he kept saying. “I want to do a novel.”

“And so you will, sir. And so you will. But please be patient. This is a very complicated adjustment I have to make.”

“Everyone tells me I ought to do a novel,” Mr Bohlen cried. “All sorts of publishers are chasing after me day and night begging me to stop fooling around with stories and do something really important instead. A novel’s the only thing that counts – that’s what they say.”

“We’re going to do novels.” Knipe told him. “Just as many as we want. But please be patient.”

“Now listen to me, Knipe. What I’m going to do is a serious novel, something that I’ll make ‘em sit up and take notice. I’ve been getting rather tired of the sort of stories you’ve been putting my name to lately. As a matter of fact, I’m none too sure you haven’t been trying to make a monkey out of me.”

“A monkey, Mr Bohlen?”

“Keeping all the best ones for yourself, that’s what you’ve been doing.”

“Oh no, Mr Bohlen! No!”

“So this time I’m going to make damn sure I write a high class intelligent book. You understand that.”

“Look, Mr Bohlen. With the sort of switchboard I’m rigging up, you’ll be able to write any sort of book you want.”

And this was true, for within another couple of months, the genius of Adolph Knipe had not only adapted the machine for novel writing, but had constructed a marvelous new control system which enabled the author to pre-select literally any type of plot and any style of writing he desired. There were so many dials and levers on the thing, it looked like the instrumental panel of some enormous aeroplane.

First, by depressing one of a series of master buttons, the writer made his primary decision: historical, satirical, philosophical, political, romantic, erotic, humorous, or straight. Then, from the second row (the basic buttons), he chose his theme: army life, pioneer days, civil war, world war, racial problem, wild west, country life, childhood memories, seafaring, the sea bottom and many, many more. The third row of buttons gave a choice of literary style: classical, whimsical, racy, Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce, feminine, etc. The fourth row was for characters, the forth for wordage – and so on and so on – ten long rows of pre-elect buttons.

But that wasn’t all. Control had also to be exercised during the actual writing process (which took about fifteen minutes per novel), and to do this the author had to sit, as it were, in the driver’s seat, and pull (or push) a battery of labeled stops, as on an organ. By so doing, he was able continually to modulate or merge fifty different and variable qualities such as tension, surprise, humour, pathos, and mystery. Numerous dials and gauges on the dashboard itself told him throughout exactly how far along he was with his work.

Finally, there was the question of “passion”. From a careful study of the books at the top of the bestseller lists for the past year, Adolph Knipe had decided that this was the most important ingredient of all – a magical catalyst that somehow or other could transform the dullest novel into a howling success – at any rate financially. But Knipe also knew that passion was powerful, heady stuff, and must be prudently dispensed – the right proportions at the right moments: and to ensure this, he had devised an independent control consisting of two sensitive sliding adjusters operated by foot-pedals, similar to the throttle and brake in a car. One pedal governed the percentage of passion to be injected, the other regulated its intensity. There was no doubt, of course – and this was the only drawback – that the writing of a novel by the Knipe methods was going to be rather like flying a plane and driving a car and playing an organ all at the same time, but this did not trouble the inventor. When all was ready, he proudly escorted Mr Bohlen into the machine house and began to explain the operating procedure for the new wonder.

“Good God, Knipe! I’ll never be able to do all that! Dammit man, it’d be easier to write the thing by hand!”

“You’ll soon get used to it, Mr Bohlen, I promise you. In a week or two, you’ll be doing it without hardly thinking. It’s just like learning to drive.”

Well, it wasn’t quite as easy as that, but after many hours of practice, Mr Bohlen began to get the hang of it, and finally, late one evening, he told Knipe to make ready for running off the first novel. It was a tense moment, with the fat little man crouching nervously in the driver’s seat, and the tall toothy Knipe fussing excitedly around him.

“I intend to write an important novel, Knipe.”

“I am sure you will, sir. I am sure you will.”

With one finger, Mr Bohlen carefully pressed the necessary preselector buttons:

Master button - satirical

Subject – racial problem

Style – classical

Characters – six men, four women, one infant

Length – fifteen chapters

At the same time he had his eye particularly upon three organ stops marked power, mystery, profundity.

“Are you ready, sir?”

“Yes, yes, I’m ready.”

Knipe pulled the switch. The great engine hummed. There was a deep whirring sound from the oiled movement of fifty thousand cogs and rods and levers; then came the drumming of the rapid electrical typewriter, setting up a shrill, almost intolerable clatter. Out into the basket flew the typewritten pages – one very two seconds. But what with the noise and the excitement and having to play upon the stops, and watch the chapter-counter and the pace-indicator and the passion-gauge, Mr Bohlen began to panic. He reacted in precisely the way a learner driver does in a car – by pressing both feet hard on the pedals and keeping them there until the thing stopped.

“Congratulations on your first novel,” Knipe said, picking up the great bundle of typed pages from the basket.

Little pearls of sweat were oozing all over Mr Bohlen’s face. “It sure was hard work, my boy.”

“But you got it done, sir. You got it done.”

“Let me see it, Knipe. How does it read?”

He started to go through the first chapter, passing each finished page to the younger man.

“Good heavens, Knipe! What’s this!” Mr Bohlen’s thin purple fish-lip was moving slightly as it mouthed the words, his cheeks were beginning slowly to inflate.

“But look here, Knipe! This is outrageous!”

“I must say it’s a bit fruity, sir”

“Fruity! It’s perfectly revolting! I can’t possibly put my name to this!”

“Quite right, sir. Quite right!”

“Knipe! Is this some nasty trick you’ve been playing on me?”

“Oh no, sir! No!”

“It certainly looks like it.”

“You don’t think, Mr Bohlen, that you mightn’t have been pressing a little hard on the passion control pedals, do you?”

“My dear boy, how should I know.”

“Why don’t you try another?”

So Mr Bohlen ran off a second novel, and this time it went according to plan.

Within a week, the manuscript had been read and accepted by an enthusiastic publisher. Knipe followed with one in his own name, then made a dozen more for good measure. In no time at all, Adolph Knipe’s Literary Agency had become famous for its large stable of promising young novelists. And once again the money started rolling in.

It was at this stage that young Knipe began to display a real talent for big business.

“See here, Mr Bohlen,” he said. “We still got too much competition. Why don’t we just absorb all the other writers in the country?”

Mr Bohlen, who now sported a bottle-green velvet jacket and allowed his hair to cover two-thirds of his ears, was quite content with things the way they were. ”Don’t know what you mean, my boy. You can’t just absorb writers.”

“Of course you can, sir, exactly like Rockefeller did with his oil companies. Simply buy them out, and if they won’t sell, squeeze them out. It’s easy!”

“Careful now, Knipe. Be careful.”

“I’ve got a list here, sir, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do is offer each one of them a lifetime contract with pay. All they have to do is undertake never to write another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff. How about that.”

“They’ll never agree.”

“You don’t know writers, Mr Bohlen. You watch and see.”

“What about the creative urge, Knipe?”

“It’s bunk! All they are really interested in is the money – just like everybody else.”

In the end, Mr Bohlen reluctantly agreed to give it a try, and Knipe, with his list of writers in his pocket, went off in a large chauffeur-driven Cadillac to make his calls.

He journeyed first to the man at the top of the list, a very great and wonderful writer, and he had no trouble getting into the house. He told his story and produced a suitcase full of sample novels and a contract for the man to sign which guaranteed him so much a year for life. The man listened politely, decided he was dealing with a lunatic, gave him a drink, then firmly showed him to the door.

The second writer on the list, when he saw Knipe was serious, actually attacked him with a large metal paper-weight, and the inventor had to flee down the garden followed by such a torrent of abuse and obscenity as he had never heard before.

But it took more than this to discourage Adolph Knipe. He was disappointed but not dismayed, and off he went in his big car to seek his next client. This one was a female, famous and popular, whose fat romantic books sold by the million across the country. She received Knipe graciously, gave him tea, and listened attentively to his story.

“It all sounds very fascinating,” she said. “But of course I find it a little hard to believe.”

“Madam,” Knipe answered. “Come with me and see it with your own eyes. My car awaits you.”

So off they went, and in due course, the astonished lady was ushered into the machine house where the wonder was kept. Eagerly, Knipe explained its workings, and after a while he even permitted her to sit in the driver’s seat and practice with the buttons.

“All right,” he said suddenly, “you want to do a book now?”

“Oh yes!” she cried. “Please!”

She was very competent and seemed to know exactly what she wanted. She made her own pre-selections, then ran off a long, romantic, passion-filled novel. She read through the first chapter and became so enthusiastic that she signed up on the spot.

“That’s one of them out of the way,” Knipe said to Mr Bohlen afterwards. “A pretty big one too.”

“Nice work, my boy.”

“And you know why she signed?”

“Why?”

“It wasn’t the money. She’s got plenty of that.”

“Then why?”

Knipe grinned, lifting his lip and baring a long pale upper gum. “Simply because she saw the machine-made stuff was better than her own.”

Thereafter, Knipe wisely decided to concentrate only upon mediocrity. Anything better than that – and there were so few it didn’t matter much – was apparently not quite so easy to seduce.

In the end, after several months of work, he had persuaded something like seventy per cent of the writers on his list to sign the contract. He found that the older ones, those who were running out of ideas and had taken to drink, were the easiest to handle. The younger people were more troublesome. They were apt to become abusive, sometimes violent when he approached them; and more than once Knipe was slightly injured on his rounds.

But on the whole, it was a satisfactory beginning. This last year – the first full year of the machine’s operation – it was estimated that at least one half of all the novels and stories published in the English language were produced by Adolph Knipe upon the Great Automatic Grammatizator.

Does this surprise you?

I doubt it.

And worse is yet to come. Today, as the secret spreads, many more are hurrying to tie up with Mr Knipe. And all the time the screw turns tighter for those who hesitate to sign their names.

This very moment, as I sit here listening to the howling of my nine starving children in the other room, I can feel my own hand creeping closer and closer to that golden contract that lies over on the other side of the desk.

Give us strength, Oh Lord, to let our children starve.
