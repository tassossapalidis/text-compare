(at the Krusty Krab)
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, something ain't right. (a birthday cake on a cart rolls in. The icing reads "Happy Birthday Krabs") For me?
Squidward: Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
Mr. Krabs: Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing. (about to blow out the candle when Plankton pops out from underneath the candle)
Plankton: Surprise! (takes out the candle and releases the balloons. The balloons pop and confetti goes everywhere. The light from the popping blinds the customers. Plankton's cart engages in its jet pack and launches itself into the kitchen. Plankton releases the bottom part of the cake onto the safe in the kitchen. The cake explodes and Plankton takes the formula and flies out of the kitchen)
Mr. Krabs: Me secret formula!
Plankton: Happy Birthday Krabs!
SpongeBob: Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. (squirts Plankton with ketchup & mustard)
Mr. Krabs: Attaboy, SpongeBob! (turns the ceiling fan on. Plankton's machine bounces off of it and breaks on the floor. SpongeBob snatches the secret formula with his tongue and swallows it)
SpongeBob: Safe.
Plankton: You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back. (gets his jet pack out but its upside down so he flies into the floor) Oh, barnacles. (everyone is groaning and moaning)
SpongeBob: Why, Mr Krabs? Why does he hate us so?
Mr. Krabs: You might as well blame me, SpongeBob. (sits on a barrel seat) There was a time when Plankton and I were best friends. (everyone gasps and runs up to hear the story)
SpongeBob: Best friends?
Mr. Krabs: Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones. (flashback to Krabs and Plankton as babies)
Plankton: Goo! (Krabs laughs then puts Plankton on his crib mobile. Everyone aw's. Cut to birthday cake reading "Big Boys". Krabs sticks out his tongue to get Plankton to blow out the candles)
Mr. Krabs: Things were all peaches and creams. (Plankton blows out the candles then jumps in the cake. Cut to elementary school) Until we hit grade school. Hey, Planky, whatcha doing?
Plankton: Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out. (a spitball hits Plankton in the back of his head. Classmates laugh) Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away. (muffled explosion. Plankton's container blew up all over his table. Classmates laugh)
Classmate: How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000? (uses Plankton as a spitball and spits him in Krabs' eye)
Plankton: They'll pay for this one day Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
Classmate: You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. Sorry you have to hang out with rag boy. (class laughs)
Classmate #2: Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping? The trash can?
Mr. Krabs: 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash. You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to fashion me clothes from rags. (flashback to Krabs' mother sewing up clothes)
Mama Krabs: There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.
Old Man Jenkins: Oops. (rips off Mr. Krab's clothes and uses it as a rag to dry his boat) I missed a spot.
Mr. Krabs: Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life. What in neptune's name is that? (picks up a penny off the ground) It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!
Plankton: It's money.
Mr. Krabs: Money?
Plankton: Yeah. You can buy things with it.
Mr. Krabs: Buy things? So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. (Mr Krabs buys a balloon for Plankton but when he gives it to Plankton, Plankton flies up into the sky because of his weight)
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here.
Mr. Krabs: I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. (shoves it away with a pencil)

Fish: So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?
Squidward: Yeah. I really wanna know.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called "Stinky Burgers". It was the only place to get a burger. Kids loved Stinky's. (all the kids are clamoring) And Stinky loved the kids.
Stinky: Now, what can I do for you young 'uns?
Classmate: Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one Stinky Burger, please!
Fish #2: Me, too, Stinky!
Stinky: Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone. (all the kids cheer)
Fish #3: That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.
Fish #4: We don't like Stinky, we respect him.
Stinky: Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like me or respect me?
Fish #3: Like!
Fish #4: Respect!
Fish #3: Like!
Fish #4: Respect!
Stinky: Ok, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me. (all the kids cheer)
Mr. Krabs: Excuse us!
Plankton: Valuable customers coming through.
Fish #3: What are those dorks doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Two Stinky Burgers, please.
Stinky: Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.
All: Yeah, Stinky!
Classmate: Thanks for keeping the nerds out.
Classmate #2: You're the best, Stinky.
Stinky: Ok, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy. (Mr. Krabs is knocking on the door in the back of the building. Stinky opens up the door) Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li... (his watch beeps) Is it quitting time already? (rips off his clothes to reveal some nicer clothes underneath) Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials. (gets in his limo and moves the stack of cash over on the seat. As he closes the door and drives off, a dollar flies into Mr. Krabs' hand)
Plankton: Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
Mr. Krabs: Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot. (cash register dings as Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into dollar bill signs) But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
Plankton: Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! (laughs)
Mr. Krabs: (cut to Mr. Krabs and Plankton walking by the dump) So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. (Mr. Krabs and Plankton work together to make a burger and go through the steps of doing so)
Plankton: Gently. Gently. (holds up the burger on a platter)
Mr. Krabs: We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant. (Mr. Krabs and Plankton turned a trailer in the dump into a restaurant. Mr. Krabs cut the 'grand opening' tape while Plankton pushed a button to signal for customers. A line of customers line up in front of the restaurant) Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. (the kid gives his dollar for a burger)
Plankton: There you are, sir.
Mr. Krabs: T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
Fish #5: Hey! Your burger's even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.
Plankton: Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
Mr. Krabs: I thought it was our recipe.
Plankton: I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! (laughs)
Mr. Krabs: But what about satisfying the customer?
Plankton: Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world! (laughs) And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Mr. Krabs: Give me that!
Plankton: Stop! You're gonna bust it! (the recipe tears in half)
Mr. Krabs: Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
Plankton: I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
Mr. Krabs: Which one? The one that says "Eject" or the one that says "Trap Door"?
Plankton: Oh, either one will do.
Mr. Krabs: What I was saying was... (Plankton pulls a string that launches Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant) You'll regret this one day! (Mr. Krabs lands in the trash. Flashback to present) And he always did.
Plankton: (pops out of the pepper shaker) Lies! (SpongeBob is about to swallow the formula again but Mr Krabs takes it and puts it in his back pocket)
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
Plankton: Very touching, but completely false.
Mr. Krabs: Don't know what you mean.
Plankton: Why don't you tell them the truth?
SpongeBob: It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?
Plankton: Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. (flashback again to restaurant. Mr. Krabs laughs)
Mr. Krabs: First, I'll rule their stomachs and then... (laughs) ...their money! (Mr. Krabs laughs)
Plankton: But what about satisfying the customers?
Mr. Krabs: Barnacles to the customers! (Plankton gasps) I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Plankton: Gimme that! (both try to take the formula)
Mr. Krabs: Stop, you're gonna bust it. (formula tears in half)
Plankton: This isn't about money, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Malarkey. (Mr. Krabs puts Plankton in a straw and spits him out)
Plankton: You'll regret this one day! (lands in a pile of trash) Ouch. (emerges and looks at the half of his recipe) Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
SpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.
Karen: That's because it isn't.
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, & Plankton: Karen?!
Karen: You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.
Plankton: It was only our third date.
Karen: Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks. (flashback on Karen's computer screen)
Plankton: Now that's a handsome looking burger.
Mr. Krabs: You said it, old chum. (over intercom) Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here! (a tumbleweed rolls by) Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump?

(music is playing in the background)
Plankton: What's that music?
Mr. Krabs: I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! (Old Man Jenkins puts a tire in his boat)
Old Man Jenkins: I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.
Mr. Krabs: You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
Old Man Jenkins: Why, I'd be happy to! (bites into the burger then smiles)
Mr. Krabs & Plankton: Yeah! (Old Man Jenkins falls over. Later, a newspaper appears on screen)
Mr. Krabs: "Plab Patties K.O. Old Man J..." I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.
Plankton: Well, he is old.
Mr. Krabs: Hey. that guy is like family to me.
Plankton: Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
Mr. Krabs: You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.
Plankton: You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
Mr. Krabs: No way, that recipe's mine! (both fight over the recipe)
Plankton: Stop, you're gonna... (recipe tears in half, sending both into opposite sides of the restaurant. Plankton walks out)You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! (slams the door causing a shelf, above the boiling patty, to spill the jars into the cauldron)
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything. (licks some of the patty mix) I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
Karen: Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone. (Plankton puts a Chum Bucket bucket with meat in it while Mr. Krabs wheels in "Krabby Patties" and knocks him over)
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't! This is my terf.
Plankton: I think not, Rag Boy.
Mr. Krabs: What? Why I outta squash you right now. You little...
Plankton: Get out of my face! (both growl at each other)
Fish #6: Hey, look! Nerd fight.
Bully: I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.
Plankton: Aha! We'll let the customers decide who's burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
Classmate: Big Johnny will eat anything.
(Big Johnny walks over to Plankton's side)
Plankton: Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. (Johnny eats it)
Karen: Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.
Plankton: Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! (Big Johnny spits the burger out on both his friends)
Classmate: I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.
Mr. Krabs: Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. (hands him a patty. He takes a bite and instantly enjoys it)
Classmate: Flavor!
Fish #7: Edible!
Kid Fish: We can actually hold it down!
Fish #8: This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!
All: Yay, Rag Boy!
Plankton: I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do! (flashback ends)
Mr. Krabs: Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best.
Plankton: You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me.
Mr. Krabs: You callin' me a liar?
Karen: Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship. (both tear up)
Mr. Krabs: You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.
Plankton: My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
Mr. Krabs: Really?
Plankton: It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
Mr. Krabs: I'd like that, Planky, old chum. (both hug and cry at the same time)
SpongeBob: Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?
Karen: I suppose it would. If I had one.
Plankton: I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.
Mr. Krabs: Me, too. Me, too. (Plankton grabs the formula from Mr. Krabs' back pocket)
Plankton: Now, Karen! (Karen grabs the formula) Back off, Rag Boy. (jumps on the formula and Karen wheels off)
SpongeBob: [gasp] Sabotage!
Plankton: Go, Karen!
[They chase each other in a circle as another episode draws to a close]

(At the Krusty Krab...)
Old man Jenkins: I just can't decide what to order.
Squidward: You already ordered.
Old Man Jenkins: Don't rush me, young lady!
Squidward: Hurry up, SpongeBob!
(Back in the kitchen, SpongeBob is filling in a ketchup heart on a Krabby Patty.)
Squidward: What is taking you so long?
SpongeBob: I'm adding the love!
Squidward: You're not getting paid to love.
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not here for the money. (Puts the top bun on and walks out. SpongeBob talks to the Krabby Patty on his way to the customer's table.) I'll always treasure these moments we had together.
Squidward: Look!!!
(He points to outside, where a solid gold limousine pulls up to the Krusty Krab. Everyone gasps, then runs out to the limo, knocking over and walking over SpongeBob. When SpongeBob lifts his head, to his great disappointment, he sees his burger is trampled with a big footprint in the middle.)
SpongeBob: Awww...
(Back outside, a security guard opens the limo door for someone.)
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!
(Out of the limo steps a bald, overweight, blue fish wearing a fast food cap, and a yellow shirt. He walks into The Krusty Krab.)
Jim: Krabs!
SpongeBob: The Jim!?! He who flipped patties in the before times?
Mr. Krabs: You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?
Jim: It sure is. I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.
Squidward: Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class.
SpongeBob: Yeah. When this place had class... (We see a flashback of Mr. Krabs the same old outfit, except he has a blue sweater like his current blue shirt and a medallion that has a "$" on it. He also has sideburns, and is dancing in a Krusty Krab that looks like the same from the outside, but looks like a ballroom from the inside with white floors and pink wallpaper. Squidward comes out from the boat in front of the ordering window, which is brown and has a painted wooden mermaid on the front. He lifts off his Krusty Krab hat to reveal long, blonde hair that goes all the way to his thighs. He walks over to Krabs, who points to the kitchen door. Out comes Jim, holding a "Jim Patty", with his named signed on the side in ketchup. The only difference with Jim is that he has curly brown hair and a zit beneath his lip. When Krabs and Squidward see the Jim patty, the clutch each other in amazement, then take baskets and skip around Jim, sprinkling flower petals on him as he holds up the Jim Patty. End flashback, and the whole Krusty Krew is laughing, including SpongeBob. They stop and stare at him until he stops also.) Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?
Squidward: No.
(Jim walks up to the "Employee of the Month" wall.
Jim: Hey, that's new. "Employee of the Month", huh?
SpongeBob: That's me!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.
(He punches the wall and all of SpongeBob's pictures fall on him and break. Underneath is a giant photo of Jim.)
Mr. Krabs: Your "Best Employee Ever" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
(Mr. Krabs and Jim sit at a table and talk about their lives.)
Jim: After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury.
SpongeBob: Would you sign my Krabby Patty?
(Shows him the smashed patty from earlier.)
Jim: Oh, I... Don't sign what I didn't make.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?
Jim: You're on, Krabs! But I'll have to charge you!
(Mr. Krabs laughs hysterically while Jim grins and sips his soda.)
Mr. Krabs: Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Not unless you look RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!
Mr. Krabs: (Gasps) You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!
(We see Squidward walking by, a wet toilet plunger in hand.)
Squidward: Now I feel complete!
Mr. Krabs: Now how's about that patty?
Jim: Everyone, watch and learn!
(Everyone gathers at the kitchen doorway as Jim enters, but the door closes and Jim's bodyguards block it.)
Bodyguard #1: No one watches Jim.
(Jim rings the bell and holds out a burger through the ordering window.)
Jim: One patty! The right way.
Mr. Krabs: It's a thing of beauty!
SpongeBob: What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway? (Takes a bite out of it.) Meh, it's OK. (His eyes widen and he is transported to a mystical world, full of stars and patties. He rides on one, but it disappears, and he falls. But suddenly he becomes one and slides on a rainbow down into SpongeBob's mouth at the Krusty Krab.) Wow! That was... amazing! (SpongeBob walks up to Jim, who is at a table flirting with girls.) Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?
Jim: Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?
SpongeBob: I'm the new fry cook, sir.
Jim: Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?
SpongeBob: Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?
Jim: Besides don't step on the food?
SpongeBob: Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!
Jim: Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it! (Later, we see SpongeBob and Jim in the kitchen, training. SpongeBob hands a completed patty to Jim, and Jim weighs it. SpongeBob is very excited, until he follows Jim into the bathroom and watches him flush the patty down the toilet.) The pickle slices were too thick.
(SpongeBob grills another one, and flips it into the air, and struggles to somehow make it levitate until Jim says to stop.)
Jim: Hold it... Hold it... Hold it... And... stop.
(Later, as SpongeBob is finished crafting the Krabby Patty, Jim steps on it and lifts his foot, covered in mustard.)
Jim: Now, too much mustard, see?
(SpongeBob takes his finger and licks some off. Cut to SpongeBob making more patties, Jim taste testing them, and then flushing them. Eventually, the toilet gets so full, that it backs up. SpongeBob runs out of the stall, crying. A fish approaching the stall sees this.)
Fish #1: Oh, man!
SpongeBob: Am I a fraud?
(He cries, and Squidward knocks on the door.)
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
SpongeBob: Crying my eyes out.
Squidward: Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.
SpongeBob: Why, Squidward?
Squidward: Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!
(SpongeBob bursts into tears.)
Squidward: Really? (Mexican Fiesta music starts to play.) Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!
(SpongeBob walks into the bathroom and sits on a pile of waterlogged patties.)
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign. (He clicks his spatula like a pen, and starts writing on a roll of toilet paper.) "Dear Mr. Krabs,"...
(Later, he walks out of the bathroom to see a crowd towards the front of the Krusty Krab.)
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: (Gasps) Me?
Mr. Krabs: Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.
All But Mr. Krabs and Squidward: Hip, hip, Hooray!
(SpongeBob runs into the kitchen.)
SpongeBob: Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain. (Runs into the freezer.) Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.
Narrator: 298 frozen patties later...
SpongeBob:(Runs out of the freezer) Goodbye, freezer.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? (SpongeBob hides in the freezer as Mr. Krabs walks in.) SpongeBob? (Smells something in the air.) That smells like a resignation note. (leaves the resignation notice under a patty bun on the grill with a flag on the top saying "Mr. Krabs" on it.) SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!
(Jim walks in.)
Jim: Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?
Mr. Krabs: He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off! 
Jim: Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!
(They laugh over their own little joke, and SpongeBob watches from the freezer window.)
SpongeBob: Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.
Jim: What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.
SpongeBob: But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.
Jim: Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions. (Flash back to Jim and Squidward, both with hair, talking at the Krusty Krab.) We should open our own restaurant and stop lining Old Man K's pockets.
Squidward: No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.
Jim: What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?
Squidward: Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.
(His hair disintegrates and falls out of his head instantly.)
Jim: Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs. (Walks into Mr. Krabs's office.) Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?
Mr. Krabs: Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.
Jim: Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you. You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel.
Mr. Krabs: What now?
Jim: You know, lay a patch.
Mr. Krabs: 'Scuse me?
Jim: Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.
Mr. Krabs: A raise? That's not in my "Hiptionary". Help me get with it, Jack.
Jim: Stop talking like that.
Mr. Krabs: These sideburns aren't real.
(Mr. Krabs rips them off.)
Jim: I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?
(Mr. Krabs starts laughing uncontrollably. When he doesn't stop, Jim leaves, not stopping to listen to Squidward's complaints about his hair. End flashback, and we are back to the modern day Krusty Krab, where Krabs is still laughing.)
Mr. Krabs: Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then.
(We see Squidward crying over his bald head.)
Mr. Krabs: You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!
SpongeBob: Wow! I never thought about it that way!
Mr. Krabs: So, you'll stay?
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
Jim: Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.
SpongeBob: The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump. 
SpongeBob: Oh.

SpongeBob: [Reading] from the festering brine of the darkest darkness, crawled forth monsters of such vile nature, whose appearance was so hideous and threatening, that the author died trying to recount them in this novel!" (Closes the book and shudders.) That story is so scary! But it's only a story, right, Gary? (Gary is literally stiff with fear. He quakes and falls on his side. SpongeBob picks him up and puts him into bed next to him.) Why don't you sleep up here tonight, Gary? (Silence.) Well, I guess I should turn off the light now. (He does so.) Sure is dark. (He then sees a green monster with its brain protruding from his head in the dark. He gasps, screams and turns the light back on to reveal his inflatable raft chair.) Oh, it's just a chair! I guess I'm imagining things in the dark. (He turns off the light and hears a knocking on his window. He turns to it and sees that there's a shriveled green claw knocking.) Whoa! Another monster! (He turns on his light to reveal it's a green coral branch floating in the current.) Oh, it's just a coral branch. Nothing to be scared of! (He hears a creaking sound as if his door had opened.) What was that? (Turns the light on and off multiple times, seeing monsters over and over. The next day, at the Krusty Krab...)
Mr. Krabs: Hey, Squidward have you seen SpongeBob? [At that moment a very drowsy and tried SpongeBon walks in, We see a close-up og his 5 o'clock shadow, bloodshot eyes and droopy nose]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie
SpongeBob: Oh, it's nothing Mr. Kravs, I just had a rough night, but it's nice and bright today! [He walks info the kitchen and we hear a big clatter from outside. Mr. Krabs bursts through the kitchen door]
Mr. Krabs: Meanderling mermaids! What's all this racket boy? [We see SpongeBob running around in circles with a pot on his head]
SpongeBob: [screams] The Dark Get if off Get if Off Get if Off Get in Off get in Off Get in Off {Mr. Krabs pulls it his head]
Mr. Krabs: Get a hold of yourself, boy [SpongeBon is silent but then]
SpongeBob: [blinks and screams]
Mr. Krabs What is it now, boy?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blinks and screams] [blinks and screams again] Whenever I blink, I see nothing
but the darkness!

Mr. Krabs: Then don't blink
SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs [Puts two rench fries between his eyelids to prop then open]
SpongeBob: Yes, it's working... {his eyes are unable to function properly and hut, the French fries snap and go flyning: SpongeBon screams]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, that's enough! We've got 15 orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties.
SpongeBob: You want me to go in there
SpongeBob: Sawe me, the Darkness!
Mr. Krabs: Now look here. Your work is starting to affect me orifits. You need to get some shut-eye why don't you get yourself a night light?
SpongeBob: Night Light?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, boy it"ll keep your room lit so you won't be sacred stiff
SpongeBob: Great idea, Mr. Krabs {the night SpongeBob browses Barg N Mart wearinh his green pajamas and nightcap] Night light night light,, Oh! Oh It's beautiful! Execuse me! Are these night lights guaranteed to keep the ceepy creatuers to the dark away?
Debbie: If I answer "Yes" will you leave the score sooner?
SpongeBob: Now that I cen see ..[Jumps up and floats into bed] Woo-hoo! I can sleep! [He yawns and pulls over the covers. But suddenly, he *screams again] I wonder wthat;s in may dark scary-lookinh bathromm!
[Screams again and returns to Barg N Mart then screams some more] Night light! Night light![We see a shot of the Debbie, sipping coffee, as SpongeBob panics and darts to the back of the store. Then, he approaches the camera, night light in hand. He leaves a dollar on the counter] Oh, thank you thank you [At home, he plugs it in and sighs with relief. Then, he screams, seeing that his closet is dark. He runs back to Barg N Mart and we see the same shot as earlier. He runs home and puts a night light in his closet, but notices that his hallway is dark. He runs to and from and to and from Barg N Mart. Then, back at home, we see him plugging in the rest of the night lights. Screaming]
There, there, there, and there. [Plugs one into an outlet in his medicine cabinet, under his fridge, in his toilet, and the back of Gary's shell] I've been needing to change your tail light anyways, Gary. [He giggles. We see his whole living room is covered with a wall of millions of night lights] Now there's not one square inch of dark!

Gary: Meow
SpongeBob: What was that, Gary?
Gary: Meow
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary! I've got darkness inside of me! [He turns on two flashlights and sticks them in his eye sockets. Outside his pineapple, the whole thing seems to be glowing orange from all the lights. It wakes Patrick up, and he walks outside]
Patrick: SpongeBob's having a party without me? [Walks over to SpongeBob's pineapple and knocks on the door] Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that. [SpongeBob opens the door and yanks Patrick inside]
SpongeBob: That was close, Patrick! You're safe under these night lights. But you can't go out in the dark, buddy! You don't know what kind of creepy critter could be lurking in those shadows!
Patrick: Oh! [Patrick starts shuddering, and runs out. SpongeBob follows, but gets bounced back be the door, into his chair beside Gary]
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick! [He hear a thundering sound and the ground shakes] What is that, Gary? [We see Patrick's rock smash through the wall and he slides it into SpongeBob's pineapple. Gary climbs on the armrest of SpongeBobs inflatable chair that he's in as its pushed into the other wall, where it pops. SpongeBob runs over to Patrick, who is panting and out of breath] Patrick, what are you doing!?!
Patrick: Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.
SpongeBob: You know what that means? [He somersaults into the air and dies a flip. He lands on a neon light that says "Sleepover". Confetti sprinkles from the roof, and SpongeBob's tongue rolls out like a noisemaker] Sleepover! [He jumps down, two sleeping bags in hand. He bows and presents one to Patrick] Your sleeping bag, sir.
Patrick: Thank you, my good man. [Both unroll theirs in a regal manner, hop inside each of theirs, and dance to a sea shanty. When they're done, they laugh]
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick! I'm so glad you made that gaping hole in the wall, letting in all t-t-t-t-t-t...
Both: The dark! [They both scream and jump out of their sleeping bags. They stand on the other side of Patrick's rock, away from the hole, and under the lights. Meanwhile, at Squidward's house, the light reflects off of his picture frame, to his vanity-dresser mirror, to his hand-held mirror, and to his sky roof window, where it shines down on his eyes, covered by a sleeping mask. The light laser burns his eyes to a crisp]
Squidward: [screams] Burning! [He cools his eyes with his glass of water on his nightstand. Through his singed, blackened, and charred eyes, he looks out the window to see Spongebob and Patrick. Back at the pineapple, SpongeBob and Patrick cling to each other, quivering and shivering]
SpongeBob: The darkness, Patrick. I can feel it. Like it's creeping up on us... [Squidward darts in front of them]
Squidward: What are you two whimpering about? [Both scream, and Patrick jumps into SpongeBob's mouth for protection]
Squidward: It's me, Squidward, you idiots! [Patrick pops out of SpongeBob's mouth]
Patrick: Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?
SpongeBob: But, Squidward! Without our night lights, the creepy creatures of the dar-
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination. [Squidward starts nearing the exit, when Patrick drags behind him, tugging on the back of his nightgown]
Patrick: No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark! [The back of Squidward's nightgown tears off] Oh, why won't he listen? [Patrick cries over SpongeBob's shoulder, and SpongeBob consoles him by giving him a pat on the back]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what if Squidward's right? What if all this is all in our imagination?
Patrick: Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!
SpongeBob: You said it, Pat! [They run outside and return with a huge neon sign]
Patrick: Quick! Turn it on, SpongeBob! [He does so. The light says "Pinky's Dance Studio" and has mechanical swaying legs with fishnet tights on] More lights! [They run out and return with a spotlight. Patrick shines it on his face, which causes it to become all crusty and starts to crumble] Now, SpongeBob! More lights! [They run to a lighthouse and Patrick tips it over onto SpongeBob. Then, they carry it into SpongeBob's house through the hole Patrick made, and slide it onto Patrick's rock. The whole house is elevated because of this, until it snaps in half and the bottom half lands like normal. Cut to Shady Shoals Rest Home, where superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sit on a couch watching TV. Barnacle Boy has dozed off]
Fish #1: [On TV] The battery-operated spoon has saved me so much time.
Mermaid Man: [Sighs] This is what passes for info-tainment these days? [Sees the "M" light in the air and mistakes it for the "MermaSignal". ] Sweet mother of Neptune's mother! Look, Barnacle Boy! A call to action! To the Invisible Boat Mobile! [Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple home]
Plankton: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Oh-Now what spoon cut shoals home it for Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy!
Patrick: More lights, SpongeBob! More lights! [They crash into Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man!?!
Patrick: Barnacle Boy!?!
SpongeBob: Aww... Are you here to protect us from the darkness that surrounds us?
Mermaid Man: We don't have time for your childish games! We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mermaid Man. There appears to be a misunderstanding. Patrick and I put up those lights to scare away the creepy creatures of the dark! We weren't trying to summon you.
Mermaid Man: Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob. Do you know how hard it is in our... advanced age... to move? Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless theres a real emergency. [Cut to a super villain dressed like a white moth. He cackles, and flutters towards SpongeBob's house] And another thing: What the-!?! [He sees the moth villain] Dear Neptune! It's the most dangerous and foreboding of all our arch nemeses—My mortal enemy whom I have searched 57 years for! Come get some, fiend! [The Moth kicks Mermaid Man in the nose, and it throbs and swells] Come back here, rival! [He becomes weary and heroically naps on Patrick's rock]ed off]
SpongeBob: Oh my gosh! Mermaid Man needs assistance! There is no need to fear, AbsorboPants is here! [The Moth flies towards the lighthouse, and SpongeBob runs up it, too. The Moth cackles]
The Moth: Savory light, come to me!
SpongeBob: Say, let me help you! [He grabs the Moth and locks him inside of the lighthouse window with the light beacon. The Moth flutters around frantically and screams. Villain Screaming] Is that enough light for you? [SpongeBob laughs, then jumps down to the heroes and Patrick] Well, he's all taken care of.
Mermaid Man: Who?
SpongeBob: The Moth, silly! Your archenemy. You'll be happy to know he won't be going anywhere anytime soon! [At that moment, the Moth pushes up on the lighthouse and flies away, taking SpongeBob's house with him]
The Moth: See you in another 57 years! [He laughs wickedly as he flutters away]
Mermaid Man: No!
Barnacle Boy: I think it's time to go home, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Why are we here again?
SpongeBob & Patrick: Bye, Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy!
Mermaid Man: Who are those to hideous creatures of the dark?
Barnacle Boy: [Yawning] I'll tell you about it in the morning. Now, drive!
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy zoom off in the Invisible Boat Mobile]

SpongeBob: We're all alone, Patrick. No lights. No shelter.
[both sobbing. Then, it is dawn and the sun rises]

Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!
[He runs up a beam of light to the sun]

SpongeBob: Pat! Come Ba... [He yawns and falls asleep on Patrick's rock. Then, Patrick comes down from the sun, his tail end flaming]
Patrick: [screams] Too much light! Too much light! [screams]

In SpongeBob's bedroom
(The big foghorn alarm wakes up SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: Good...morning, Gary!

Gary: Meow.

SpongeBob: Say, Gary, do you ever wonder what Patrick's mornings are like?

Patrick's Rock
Patrick:(cut to Patrick sleeping on his recliner. The alarm goes off and he panics) Huh? What? Huh? No!! (screaming) What's making that noise? Hu-huh? (squints his eyes to see the alarm) Oh. (laughs with relief) It's you again. (alarm keeps ringing) Okay, joke's over. (still ringing) Alright, you got me. Now cut it out. (still ringing) That's it! (grunts with exertion at the lamp) Stop your ringing, mister! I'm warning you. Stop it! I said quit it! (breaks the lamp in half but he can still hear the ringing) Where's it coming from? Make it stop. (alarm rings its way over to Patrick) You've got to help me find out where that ringing is coming from. (alarm rings its way back over to the other side) Hey, come back! Oh, fine. I'll ask someone who cares. (takes off his underwear,and therefore, is naked, then puts it on a pillow, and draws SpongeBob's face on it) SpongeBob, where's that ringing coming from? (pillow falls over on the alarm to where you can hear a rumble. Patrick's stomach grumbles) Breakfast! (cut to Patrick in front of the pantry) Come to Patrick! (opens up the cabinet and all the cans fall out) Tartar sauce. I'm out of food again. All I have is these lousy cans with pictures of food on them. I wanted real food not pictures! (sloshing the can) Oh. The food is in the can. Okay, come on out. Come on. Oh, yeah. (gets a plate and puts it on the counter) Okay, breakfast, get on the plate. Come on. Nice, comfy plate just for you. Come on, get on there. Hello? Anybody in there? (dial tone) No answer. I'm coming to rescue you. (bangs head on the can a few times) Having a little trouble reaching you. (cuckooing) You stupid cans. (throws the can away but the can hits the alarm, making it stop, and breaks in half) Oh. Food. Ah, my favorite time of the day. Breakfast and a little morning television. (turns on TV)

Announcer: And now, live from Bikini Bottom, it's "Bikini Bottom Live". (Patrick eats all the food in one spoonful. Then sticks out his tongue to reveal the alarm still ringing)

Patrick: Oh my gosh. (sticks his tongue back in his mouth and swallows the clock) I'm late, I'm late, I'm late! (Starts running) I gotta put on my teeth and brush my pants! (trips over the broken lamp, tripping down the stairs and over Gary) Gary? (flies through his drawers, coming out the other side with his pants on) Pants then flies through the bathroom, coming out with a toothbrush) A clean mouth is a happy mouth. (the toothpaste flies off the toothbrush) Darn. (Patrick bounces off the side, onto the roof, the bathtub, and out of his rock where SpongeBob is waiting)

Outside Patrick's Rock
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how was your morning?

Patrick: Oh, you know, usual.

Barg 'n Mart
(at the Barg'n Mart, SpongeBob is whistling while putting a box of Kelp cereal in his shopping cart)
SpongeBob: What's this? (reads box label) It says free prize! (braying laughter. Takes Gary and his box of cereal home and immediately dumps out all the cereal in the bowl and munches it all down) Huh? Where's my prize? (reads cereal box again) "Free Prize." (gasps) "Offer inside"! Just send in 99 box tops!

[edit]Inside SpongeBob's Kitchen
(cut to SpongeBob eating more cereal with a bunch of cereal boxes all around him)
SpongeBob: How you doing over there, Gary?
Gary: Meow. (SpongeBob opens up a box and pours the cereal in Gary's bowl) Meow.
SpongeBob: Send in the box tops... (swallows the cereal in his mouth) ...before eating all the cereal?! Gary, you are a genius! (cut to SpongeBob stuffing the envelopes with box tops. Cut to SpongeBob outside by the mailbox) I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
[edit]Outside SpongeBob's pineapple
SpongeBob & Patrick: I'm waiting. I'm waiting. We're waiting. We're waiting.
SpongeBob: We're waiting.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are we waiting for?
SpongeBob: We're waiting for the mailman. He's bringing me a free toy.
Patrick: I love toys! Can I wait for your toy with you?
SpongeBob: Why, sure.
SpongeBob & Patrick: We're waiting. We're waiting.
Patrick: There's the mailman!
Mailman: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
SpongeBob: Yup. (shuddering with excitement. Mailman hands him 3 envelopes) Isn't there anything else?
Mailman: Nope, sorry kid. (walks off whistling)
SpongeBob: Guess we'll have to keep waiting. (both wait by the mailbox. After a while, both of their stomachs growl and bark at each other)
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, I'm hungry.
SpongeBob: Me, too.
Patrick: Let's go down to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Great idea, Patrick. Krusty Krab, here we... wait a minute. What if the mailman comes when I'm gone? (clings onto the mailbox)
Patrick: What's wrong SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: If I leave, the mailman might come and I might miss him.
Patrick: Oh, I'm gonna take off then. I don't think my arm can stand much more of this. (Patrick's stomach is biting his arm)
SpongeBob: (checks mailbox) Got to stay focused. (checks mailbox again. Sandy jumps in)
Sandy: Hiya! Hey, SpongeBob, want to do some kara...!! (SpongeBob grabs her arm and flips her on her back)
SpongeBob: Not now, I'm busy. (Sandy brushes herself off and walks away. SpongeBob checks the mailbox again. Gary pushes his bowl by SpongeBob’s foot) Oh, Gary, not now. Can't you see that I'm waiting for the mailman?! Doesn't anyone understand this?!? (checks mailbox again then pants as Gary takes his bowl away) So tired. So hungry. But must wait...for toy.
Patrick: Hey, buddy.
SpongeBob: (screaming): What!?! What do you want?! Can't you see I'm doing something here?! (pokes Patrick in the head, checks mailbox) This better be good.
Patrick: You missed your surprise birthday party, so I just wanted to bring you a present and some cake because you missed it.
SpongeBob: My birthday party? I missed my birthday party?
Patrick: Yeah, see? (shows present and cake) Here's a present and your cake.
SpongeBob: My birthday cake.
Patrick: Yeah. Let me just get you a fork so you can eat it. (SpongeBob giggles) Uh, let me just hold the cake like this, (holds the piece of cake between his teeth) so I can get you a fork. (digs in pocket) Huh, I wonder where I put that fork. (notices he ate the cake) Oops.
SpongeBob: That was my cake. What is the present?

Patrick: Oh, yeah. (opens the box) A fork! (SpongeBob sniffles, then cries loudly)
SpongeBob: That stupid toy! I wasted my whole life waiting for it!
Patrick: Actually, you've only been here 20 minutes.
SpongeBob: I've been mean to Gary, and I flipped Sandy, and now you hate me 'cause... I'm a big jerk!!! (cries)
Patrick: No, I don't.
SpongeBob: Yes, you do.
Mailman: SpongeBob SquarePants?
Patrick: Could you come back later? He's having a moment.
Mailman: Yeah. I just need a signature for...
Patrick: I said he's having a moment! Now leave him alone!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, (sniff), people like me don't deserve moments. (signs for the package) I get so caught up in... Oh, here ya go. (takes package) ...in waiting for...my toy! (laughs. Patrick laughs) Whoo!
Patrick: Whoo! Yeah! (both riverdance, laugh and dance on the ground. SpongeBob opens up the package to reveal a green-headed, purple-colored body toy)
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob & Patrick: It's beautiful. (Patrick touches it and its springs pop out)
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I waited so long...
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: And you broke it...
Patrick: You okay, buddy?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes I'm okay.
Patrick: (sighs) For a sec, I...
SpongeBob: YOU!!!! YOU RUINED MY FREE TOY!!!!
Patrick: I'm sorry. Oh, maybe if you just... (pokes it but the springs stretch out. SpongeBob screams and Patrick cries. Squidward walks down the street while SpongeBob and Patrick are rolling around crying)
[edit]Outside Squidward's Easter Island Head
Squidward: Just keep walking, Squiddy. don't make eye contact. (walks into his house, goes upstairs to look out the window and see SpongeBob & Patrick still crying, then closes his window) Ah, now to soothe my frayed nerves. (crying resume in louder outcome. Squidward walks out of his house) All right, what's going on?! Why are you two crying?!
SpongeBob: (stuttering): I-I ate... box-box-box tops? And then... I'm waiting. I'm waiting. And then he came and we're waiting. We're waiting. And then my toy and then you and then snap and then this! (shows toy, SpongeBob still cries. Squidward fixes it by pushing its head down)
Squidward: There. Now see? (shows how the toy works) It's supposed to do that.
SpongeBob: Hey, my toy's okay!
Squidward: Good. Now will you two be quiet?
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, Squidward fixed it. (both run over and hug Squidward) How can we ever thank you?
Patrick: Yeah, how can we thank you? (giggles)
Squidward: Move to another neighborhood

(While SpongeBob sleeps, Gary notices his food bowl is empty. So, he slithers up to the diving board, jumps off, and licks SpongeBob, who giggles and wakes up.)

SpongeBob: Gary! What are you doing!?!

Gary: Meow.

SpongeBob: Oh my gosh! You're bowl's empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say (rushes to get food) "organic"!

Gary: Meow? *Raspberries*

SpongeBob: There ya go, Gary! (Gary sniffs it and rejects the food. He slithers over to a fungus growing on the floor, smiles, and eats some.) Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottomfeeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!

Gary: (Mocking) Meow, meow, meow...(SpongeBob attempts to clean it, but to no avail.)

SpongeBob: What is this stuff, anyway? Doesn't seem to be coming off! (The doorbell rings.) Ooh, company! (He scratches his head as he answers the door.)

Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob! (gasps)

SpongeBob: Is something wrong, Patrick?

Patrick: SpongeBob! What is that?

SpongeBob: What's what?

Patrick: This!(He bends SpongeBob's head over so he can see the fungus on his head.)

SpongeBob: Ow!!! P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?

Patrick: Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!

SpongeBob: Good idea!(He does so.)

Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: Yeah?

Patrick: I don't know about this!

SpongeBob: What makes you say that?

Patrick: This.

(He takes out a mirror and shows SpongeBob that the fungus has spread.)

SpongeBob: Ahh!!! It's getting bigger! (swallows) Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure! (He spreads some on.) Ah, that's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?

Patrick: Sure do! Well, I'm gonna go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.

SpongeBob: Bye, Patrick!

(Patrick leaves, and SpongeBob goes and takes a shower. He lathers the soap into an anchor shape, and when he rinses, the fungus is in an anchor shape.) Ah... This feels better!

[edit]SpongeBob's Entrance
SpongeBob: (We now see him doing a crossword.) Let's see. A four-letter word. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis... hmm. (He feels an itch.) ITCH!!! {He starts scratching his head.) Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swollen skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away... Eventually. (As he says this, a piece of fungus comes down onto his nose. He flings it onto the wall, but another one grows, so he pushes his nose in.) There! Outta sight, outta mind! Huh? (He sees the fungus on the wall, scoops it up, and tries to throw it away, but it sticks.) I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking! (He puts on gloves from a first aid kit.) Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties... Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must... Stop... scratching!!! (scratches)

(Squidward comes in.)

Squidward: SpongeBob, AHHHHHH!!!!!! (He sees SpongeBob scratching the fungus.) SpongeBob!

SpongeBob: Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!

Squidward: SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?

SpongeBob: All whaty?

Squidward: Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?

SpongeBob: Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward... Just a little blemish, that's all!(His nose pops out with the fungus, and Squidward screams. He jumps to the top of the cabinet.)

Squidward: That's no blemish!

SpongeBob: Help... Me!!!

Squidward: Oh, I'll help you, alright!(He takes out a phone.)

[edit]Wall Opening
S.W.A.T. Fish #1: S.W.A.T. Team. (Gibberish on the other end.) We'll be right over!(The team breaks through the ceiling of the Krusty Krab and slide down ropes from a helicopter.)

S.W.A.T. Fish #2: Hold it right there! Dear Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of ick yet.(He tries to touch SpongeBob.)

S.W.A.T. Fish #3: Stop, you fool! (smacks other fish's hand away) Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician.

Hazmat Physician: Get back! I said, get back! Back I say!(He pushes SpongeBob into a cage, which is promptly lifted by a helicopter.)

SpongeBob: What's going on, Squidward? Help!!(As the helicopter flies away, a piece of fungus attaches itself to Squidward. Later, at the cash register...)

Squidward: Here's your change, sir.(As he hands him the coins, some fungus gets on the old man. He puts them in his pockets, then readjusts his glasses, which leaves fungus all over his nose.)

Old Man Jenkins: Oh, why thank you very much, young man.

Squidward: What was that? No, no, Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick.(He scratches himself. Meanwhile, we see a SpongeBob completely covered in fungus in a bubble with tubes coming from it.)

[edit]Back at SpongeBob's House
SpongeBob: Ooh, where am I? Whoa!

{Doctors are talking to each other}

SpongeBob: Who are you people? I wanna go home!(We see a scientist walk up.)

Scientist: You are home, SpongeBob. You just need to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up.

SpongeBob: Where's my snail, Gary?

Scientist: We're taking care of your pet.(We see Gary in a bubble similar to SpongeBob's.)

Gary: Meow.

SpongeBob: Gary? Whoa!(He notices someone scanning him.)

Hazmat: He appears stable, sir.

Scientist: Alright, boys, let's pack it up.

(They leave, and we see SpongeBob's Pineapple, covered in a plastic bag, with police tape and barbed wire around it. It says "Quarantine" on it. Then, we see SpongeBob filter-feeding like in "I Had an Accident". Patrick walks in.)Patrick: Wow! (He bumps into the bubble.) Huh? What is this?(Pokes)

SpongeBob: Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!

Patrick: Really? How about if I squeeze it like this? (He squeezes it. SpongeBob gasps.) Or this? (He bites it.) Or this? (He digs cleats into it.)

SpongeBob: No!

Patrick: Or this? (He digs cleats into it.)

SpongeBob: Ah, Patrick!!! How many times do I have to tell you? Be careful!!!

Patrick: Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?

SpongeBob: Sure! Let's begin! (They take out hooks and tear up the bubble.) Um... Patrick?

Patrick: I win! I win! I win!

SpongeBob: Patrick?(He starts dancing around and doing the "Worm".)

Patrick: Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!

SpongeBob: PATRICK!!! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.

Patrick: I've got an idea!(He pulls out bubble soap and begins to blow a bubble around SpongeBob.)

SpongeBob: There's no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands! (He notices the bubble) Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile! (wheels it around a little) Now I can go back to work! (puts on hat)(Squidward's fungus is spreading. Mr. Krabs pulls him into the kitchen.)

[edit]Back at the Krusty Krab
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Help! {pulls Squidward through the window into the kitchen} Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there! (Squidward shakes his head, and gets Ick all over the patties.)

Squidward: No, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!

Mr. Krabs: Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? (sighs.) If only SpongeBob were here.

Squidward: If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in the Ick!(He scratches, oblivious to the fact that he has Ick all over him, too.) Lunch is served! (Gives Ick Patties to a couple.) Eat up, kids. (The kids bite into their Ick kid's meal, and as everyone bites into their food, Squidward scratches all over. He groans.} Why am I so itchy? (He gets some on the wall and sees that he has the fungus, screams and all the customers look at him) SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!!! (An angry mob forms around Squidward.) Stay back, you diseased freaks!

Mr. Krabs: What's all the commotion about?

Fish #1: (With accent) The commotion, my dear crabs, is regarding the hygiene of this staff of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.

Mr. Krabs: Inadequate!?! I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free. (door opens and Mr. Krabs is awestruck)

SpongeBob: Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.

(All eyes turn to SpongeBob in his bubble, who has swollen up to an enormous green square. He puts on his hat, and squirts green juice inside his bubble. The fish gasp.)

Fish #1: Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ransack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?

All: We are!

Mr. Krabs: It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!

Squidward: No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!!! {everybody growls and screams}

Fish #1: Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!!!(They attack SpongeBob, who starts crying, making a huge puddle in his bubble. Outside the Krusty Krab, Gary slithers into the dumpster and eats a can, which he coughs up. His stomach growls as he slithers out.)

Gary: Meow.(sees what's happening. Some fish body slam SpongeBob's bubble, which make holes that the Ick leaks through.)

SpongeBob: Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!!! No!!!(All the fish slam into it, and it pops, splattering Ick all over the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs starts laughing.)

Mr. Krabs: Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!

Squidward: It's not me, Mr. Krabs!

SpongeBob: Gary the snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission?(We see Gary clean the Ick off of Mr. Krabs.)

Mr. Krabs: He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid!(Gary sucks the fungus off Squidward, next.)

Peterson: Oh, oh! Me next!

Fish #3: Where are your manners? It's ladies first!

Patrick: I believe the expression is starfish first.

Fish #1: I superSede all of you. For I have an exotic accent!

Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution you'll be happy with. (Later...) Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars!(The first fish steps up, and Gary cleans him.) Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?(The guy whacks him with his hat.)

Fish #1: In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive. (pulls out money) I'll take two, please.

Mr. Krabs: Alright!(SpongeBob is next. He hands Krabs the money.)

SpongeBob: Here you go, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: Another 5 dollars for another de-icking.(Gary cleans SpongeBob off.)

SpongeBob: Look, Gare! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottomfeeder a sponge could ever have!

Mr. Krabs: Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!

(Gary burps loudly.)

(A shadow that looks like Plankton walks up to the Krusty Krab and gets inside using the code. He goes back into the office and opens up the safe and gets out the formula. SpongeBob turns on the lights to reveal the shadow is Mr. Krabs)

SpongeBob: What are you doing, Mr. Krabs?

Mr. Krabs: Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe. Plankton hasn't tried to steal the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big.

Squidward: (walks in) Hello.

Mr. Krabs: One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work.

Squidward: (walks out) Good-bye.

Mr. Krabs: I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton.

SpongeBob: Spy?! Ooh! (acts like James Bond)

Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw.

SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm gonna be a spy.

Patrick: You're a spy?! I wanna be a spy, too!

Mr. Krabs: Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet.

SpongeBob & Patrick: Hooray, we're spy buddies! (Mr. Krabs stammers. SpongeBob & Patrick whisper) Spy buddies.

Mr. Krabs: Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: In my hands... ooh!

Patrick: (examines SpongeBob’s hand) Ooh. (cut to SpongeBob’s house later that night where SpongeBob pushes the button on the patty)

Mr. Krabs: You're mission-- if you choose to accept it-- is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in ten seconds. (both scream and run around while the patty is beeping)

SpongeBob: Get rid of it! Get rid of it, Patrick! (Patrick puts the patty in his pants. It explodes and leaves the bottom half of his body without any skin)

Patrick: That's gonna leave a mark. (cut to Sandy's treedome)

SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy.

Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob, Patrick. What y'all doing?

SpongeBob: Do you know anything about spying, Sandy?

Sandy: Well, I know you need a lot of crazy gadgets like jet-packs and laser-equipped Bermuda shorts with walkie-talkies.

Walkie-talkie: 10-4, good buddy. (static)

Sandy: Cameras that fit up your nose, high-powered magnifying glass, and my favorite, the knockout ray. (blasts SpongeBob and Patrick with it causes them to knockout. Then blasts them again making them wake up)

SpongeBob: Wow, Sandy, with these gadgets, Patrick and I will be great spies.

Sandy: (laughs) I wouldn't trust you two with any of this stuff.

SpongeBob: What do we do now, Patrick? (Patrick picks up the knockout ray and knocks Sandy out. Both laugh. Cut to the city where SpongeBob and Patrick are spying from the side of a building)

Patrick: What's he doing now?

SpongeBob: Nothing yet. Wait! Wait! He's... (Plankton walks into "Guppies R Us") ...buying baby clothes? We gotta get closer.

Plankton: Excuse me? (holds up a small pink outfit) Do you have anything in a size negative five?

Employee: (laughs) Uh, sorry, bud, that's as small as they come. (takes the outfit. SpongeBob enlarges himself in the clothes on the wall)

SpongeBob: Wow, Plankton has to buy baby clothes? (Patrick enlarges himself in the outfit next to SpongeBob)

Patrick: How embarrassing. (Plankton walks out of "Guppies R Us". SpongeBob walks out a couple seconds later)

SpongeBob: SpongeBob to Krabs. Come in Krabs.

Mr. Krabs: Krabs here. Go ahead.

SpongeBob: Plankton just bought some baby clothes.

Mr. Krabs: Baby clothes? Hmm... (writes 'baby clothes' on the chalkboard) What's he doing now?

SpongeBob: Hold on. (looks through store window) He's buying...

Mr. Krabs: Yeah? Yeah?

SpongeBob: A... stamp.

Mr. Krabs: A stamp. (writes it on the chalkboard) This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob. (cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are tip-toeing behind Plankton)

SpongeBob: We're right behind him and he has no idea. (from Plankton's POV, the tip-toes are thunderous steps. He turns around)

Plankton: Would you stop making all that racket? (from SpongeBob and Patrick's POV, Plankton is squeaking as he talks so they can't understand him)

Patrick: What's he doing now?

SpongeBob: I can't tell. (they walk again but SpongeBob is shining a light on Plankton from the magnifying glass)

Plankton: Phew! Gosh, it's hot. (catches on fire and runs away screaming)

SpongeBob: He's getting away! Quick, Patrick, use the jet-pack!

Patrick: Can do! (pushes a button and Patrick grabs SpongeBob as they fly toward Plankton. Plankton jumps into a soda drink and puts himself out)

Plankton: Phew. Huh? (SpongeBob and Patrick are fly over Plankton, setting him and the cup on fire, while they fly through buildings. The jet-pack detaches itself from Patrick and they both skid on the sidewalk. When they stand up, their faces and bodies are deformed)

SpongeBob: Boy, it was lucky the sidewalk broke out fall. But we lost Plankton!

Patrick: To the spy mobile! (both hop into the car)

SpongeBob: Hmmm... mines, oil slick, smoke screen, shield...

Patrick: Self destruct!! (pushes button and the car explodes. Both laugh. Patrick's pants phone is ringing) There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.

Mr. Krabs: Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.

Patrick: It's for you.

SpongeBob: Agent SpongeBob here.

Mr. Krabs: You found out what Plankton's up to?

SpongeBob: I'm afraid we lost him, Mr. Krabs.

Mr. Krabs: Well, find him, lad. I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick.

SpongeBob: You're not paying me at all, Mr. Krabs.

Mr. Krabs: Exactly. So get to work. (hangs up)

Recording: If you'd like to make a call, please deposit twenty-five cents. (SpongeBob gets out a quarter. Cut to the Chum Bucket at night. SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof)

SpongeBob: Ok, Patrick, we're in position. Now how do we get inside?

Patrick: I think the front door's open.

SpongeBob: Spies don't use the front door, Patrick. We've got to figure out a complicated way to get inside.

Patrick: This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants! Ooh!! (shoots a laser out of his behind and cuts out a square on the roof)

SpongeBob: Good work, Patrick! Now it's my turn. (drops down inside, with the rope tied around him. He lowers himself but hits the floor) I thought you were holding the rope. (Patrick lands on top of him)

Patrick: I am. You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission!

Plankton: (turns on the lights) Secret mission, eh? {SpongeBob and Patrick scream} Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer! (cut to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting at a table holding menus and Plankton standing on the table) I'll let you two look over the menu. (He jumps off and walks away)

Patrick: SpongeBob, I have to go.

SpongeBob: Oh, can't you go later?

Patrick: {Groans} My laser pants aren't working right. (shoots a laser at the salt shaker on the other table. Patrick sighs)

Plankton: Could I interest you in a raspberry ice tea?

Patrick: Uh, no thanks.

Plankton: Or perhaps a bran muffin?

Patrick: {groans again} SpongeBob, I have to go now!

Plankton: Prune Danish? (sees Patrick's behind wiggle. Patrick groans again) What the...? (pan out to the Chum Bucket building where Patrick's laser pants makes holes everywhere and destroys the Chum Bucket. Later, the floor opens up and a blimp emerges with Plankton controlling it from the inside and SpongeBob and Patrick lying on top. Patrick sits up while SpongeBob continues to lie down) Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get! (flies his blimp over to the Krusty Krab. The inside of the Krusty Krab gets darker)

Mr. Krabs: Is it dark or have I put up with cataract surgery too long?

Squidward: No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.

Mr. Krabs: (sees the blimp) Merciful Neptune. (red light flashes) Man your battle stations!

Squidward: I'm on it! (runs into the bathroom and flushes a toilet)

Mr. Krabs: (raises himself in the crow's nest) Bring it on, Plankton.

Plankton: Oh, I will. We'll see if you have a customer left after I pump up the volume. (loud 50's pop music plays. All the customers cover their ears)

Fish: Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song. (customers leave)

Mr. Krabs: He's driving me customers away! Alright, Plankton, you want my customers so badly? You can have 'em! (sucks them all up and launches them through a cannon at the blimp)

Plankton: Do your worst, Krabs!

Squidward: (hits the blimp) I hate my job.

SpongeBob: (watching from the top of the blimp) It's up to you and me, buddy.

Patrick: Abandon ship! (jumps off the blimp and lands in the cannon. Patrick was shot out towards the blimp)

Plankton: Point-headed projectile on the port side! (Patrick makes a hole in the blimp, causing it to fly into the Krusty Krab and destroy it)

Mr. Krabs: No!

Plankton: (standing on the Krusty Krab sign with a piece of paper in his hand) I win! I always win!

SpongeBob: Not to rain on your parade or anything, but you always lose.

Plankton: No, SpongeBob, I always... (his head turns into Mr. Krabs)

Mr. Krabs: ...win!

SpongeBob: (gasps) Mr. Krabs?

Mr. Krabs: That's right! I stole me own formular!

SpongeBob: But if you're Mr. Krabs, then who's... (the other Mr. Krabs rips off his suit to show the Robot Krabs from "Imitation Krabs") Mr. Krabs is a robot!! (Robot Krabs opens its head up to reveal Plankton)

Plankton: No, you idiot.

SpongeBob: Plankton?! What the barnacles is going on here?

Mr. Krabs: You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for twenty years to steal me formula, and he's never done it.

Plankton: I almost had it 37 times, and you know it!

Mr. Krabs: Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet. (flashback to Mr Krabs laughing while Plankton is crying on the ground) You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!

Plankton: You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.

Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah right. If I was you, I could steal me formular on me first try.

Plankton: Ha! The usual wager?

Mr. Krabs: You're on. (flashback ends) So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each others lives and I beat Plankton at his own game... and destroyed his place of business!! (laughs) Now pay up.

Plankton: Here you go, Eugene! (takes out a dollar) One a-dollar!

Patrick: Not so fast! (rips his suit off to reveal Squidward)

SpongeBob: Squidward? Then who are you?

Squidward: I'm not... (SpongeBob tears off his face) ...wearing a disguise.

SpongeBob: Hmmm, if he's Squidward, then you must be... (fake Squidward rips off his suit to reveal Sandy) ...Sandy?

Sandy: Whoops, wrong outfit. (rips off suit to reveal another SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: (gasping) OOOOOOHHHHH!! You're me! Then I must be... (rips off his suit to reveal Patrick)

Patrick: Patrick!

SpongeBob: Nah, I'm just kidding. (rips off the SpongeBob suit and reveals another Patrick)

Patrick: I really am Patrick. (laughs. Other Patrick rips off his suit to reveal SpongeBob again)

SpongeBob: Good one, Patrick! (both laugh) There's just one thing I don't understand.

Mr. Krabs What's that, laddie?

SpongeBob: That. (points to two Patrick's laughing beside each other)

Narrator: "Boat Smarts with Mrs. Puff". This driving film is brought to you by: C.O.B.B.U.T.K.S.B.S.P.O.T.R.A.O.O.B.A.T. (Citizens Of Bikini Bottom United To Keep SpongeBob SquarePants Off The Road And Out Of Boats All Together)

Mrs. Puff: Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts... (cut to Squidward in an airplane uniform)

Squidward: Ripping good day for a spot of driving.

Mrs. Puff:...and a driver without boat smarts. (cut to SpongeBob sliding in on his head next to Squidward)

SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Look at what I can do with my feet! (wiggles his legs. Squidward gets angry)

Mrs. Puff: Let's see some examples, shall we? "Tire Pressure". (cut to Squidward putting air in his tires) Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level. (cut to SpongeBob pumping too much air in his tires) While this driver pays no heed to boat smarts. (tires flips the boat over. Then the tire explodes and blows air into Squidward's face)

Mrs. Puff: "Buckling Up". (cut to Squidward putting on safety belt) As demonstrated by this driver, he has enough boat smarts to use his seat belt and avoid a serious casualty as a result of a collision. (drives off but stops slowly at a stop light) Notice how he comes gently to a stop sign. (cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively) Now this driver, with not regard for safety... (Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but goes through the spikes anyways) Well, at least he had his seat belt on.

Mrs. Puff: "Adjusting Mirrors". What's our boat smarts boater up to now? (Squidward is adjusting his mirrors) You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater. (SpongeBob is running over citizens while he is adjusting his mirrors)

SpongeBob: Ah, perfect. (cuts off Squidward in the road and drives in front of him)

Squidward: Hey, use your mirrors, fool!

SpongeBob: Mirrors? Oh, that reminds me. I haven't adjusted this one yet. (adjusts it to where the light in the reflection blinds Squidward)

Squidward: Ah! Can't see! D'oh! (puts on sunglasses and giggles. Screams as he crashes into a brick wall. Footage from live-action crash test dummies is showing with Squidward's head replacing the dummy’s head) Ow.

Mrs. Puff: Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road. (Squidward's eyes turn into a lock but vision the road as well. Cut to SpongeBob eating a Krabby Patty and reading the newspaper while driving) And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety. (SpongeBob is shaving himself while driving the wrong way on a one way street. He causes a woman to crash into a streetlight pole)

Woman: (screams) Jerk!

SpongeBob: Hi there!

Man: Help! Lunatic driver! (crashes his boat into SpongeBob’s but SpongeBob’s boat is unharmed and keeps driving. He causes many drivers to flip their boats over and get in accidents)

Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law. (SpongeBob’s boat slips in some water and turns around and around)

SpongeBob: Whee! (his boat is driving backwards now) Hi, Squidward. Hi, Mrs. Puff. (Squidward and Mrs. Puff scream. SpongeBob’s boat stops on a rock and sends Squidward's boat into the air then into the pile of boat mobiles that are in the accident. Mrs. Puff blows up to a big puffer fish)

SpongeBob: Looks like you guys forgot your boat smarts! (laughs and drives off)

Mrs. Puff: Never mind. (film strip ends while we see the end of the film strip.)

(Mr. Krabs is laughing in his office as he is reading a book. SpongeBob and Squidward enter)
SpongeBob: Exciting reading Mr Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you bet you SpongeBob. Listen to this. Individual waste of the enus will substantially broaden the probability of multiple substantial visits, generating an inverse negative revenue margin of three quarters and one half of one percent: meaning if you call the customers by their names, they keep coming to spend more of their green back! So I want you two to learn the names of every customer.
Squidward: I have an important life to live, and it doesn't include chattering with you two ninnies.
Mr. Krabs: I thought you might say that, so I decided to turn this into a contest. The employee who learns more names wins this. (Squidward takes a brochure and gasps)
Squidward: A tropical getaway? On the triple decker Conhugo cruise liner? Sunbathing.... Parcheesi... ballroom dancing! This is gonna be so easy. SpongeBob doesn't realize that I'm the face of the Krusty Krab. While he's isolated in the kitchen all day, I'll be out here, building a rapport with the customers. (walks up to a female) Hello. May I get you anything else, Miss...
Christina: Since when do you give two shrimps about customer service, Mr. Grouchy Squid guy?
SpongeBob: Hi Sally! Hi, Sadie! Hi, Shubie!
Squidward: How does SpongeBob know all these names?
SpongeBob: Right back at you, Lenny!
Squidward: Hey, SpongeBob, could you take a look in the cash register? I think it's broken.
SpongeBob: Oh, sure, Squidward.
Squidward: I think you might need a closer look. Let me give you a hand. (shoves SpongeBob into the cash register)
SpongeBob: I can't see anything in here, Squidward.
Squidward: Keep looking, SpongeBob, keep on looking. (walks up to another fish)
Squidward: So, what's your name? (SpongeBob squeezes out of a mustard bottle)
SpongeBob: Hi, Thaddeus!
Squidward: Good-bye, SpongeBob. (takes the mustard bottle from the customer and puts it on the ground outside. Stomps on it and sends SpongeBob soaring into the background. Then he walks back into the Krusty Krab) That should buy me enough time to win that cruise. (another fish walks in)
Gus: Good day, young sir! My name is... (SpongeBob pops up from under his hat)
SpongeBob: Gus!
Gus: He's right! This guy's so good, you should give him a prize.
Squidward: (grabs SpongeBob) How in Neptune's creation do you know all of these names, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, I simply compile the name of every customer in this book. (holds up a book named "The Customers of the Krusty Krab and Why I Love Them. By SBSP")
Squidward: (grabs the book) Thanks, SpongeBob! (jumps from table to table saying all the fishes names) Let's see. Halbert, Norma, Isabel, Gus, Chas, Pelar, Gus, Jess, Cara, Ivy, Harv, Mable, Mavis... (crawls over to a female fish who is eating her food) And your name is... Susie Fish, correct?
Susie: Yes, and you'd also be correct in saying you ruined my food with your sweat, you nitwit! (walks out)
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! That's the last customer. Do I win?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, well, actually, I wasn't keeping score. But I'll just say that you and SpongeBob are neck and neck. That mystery guy over there will be the tie breaker.
Squidward: Uh, that's, that's...
SpongeBob: Oh, that's... that's... I know him. It's...something.
Mr. Krabs: He's the ticket to your prize.
Squidward: (shoves SpongeBob) Out of the way, loser. (runs over to the customer) Um, hello. My name is Squidward. (customer looks at him with an annoyed face) Uh, so, what's your name?
What Zit Tooya: What Zit Tooya.
Squidward: Uh, it's just that I was going to...enter your name in our sweepstakes! (takes out paper and pen) So, what should I put down?
What Zit Tooya: (gulps) First and last name?
Squidward: Sure.
What Zit Tooya: Yeah, why don't you write this on your form. What Zit... (inhales deeply) ...Tooya!! Now leave me alone! (eats his food and SpongeBob walks over)
Squidward: I see he wants to play hard to get. So be it! I have ways of making the likes of him talk. (runs up to him with a cup of soda) Uh, sir, you forgot your soda.
What Zit Tooya: I didn't order any soda.
Squidward: It's on the house. (throws the soda in the customer's face)
What Zit Tooya: What the barnacles are you doing?!
Squidward: Oh, I'm sorry, I slipped. Here, let me take that off of you. (takes the customer's jacket off) Okay, there must be a nametag or some form of I.D. in here.
What Zit Tooya: I don't need your help. I'm outta here! (Squidward follows him)
Squidward: Hey, look up in the sky! A giant meteor is hurtling towards earth.
What Zit Tooya: Where? (Squidward reaches inside fish's jacket and takes out his wallet)
Squidward: Oh, you'll see it. Just keep looking.
What Zit Tooya: I can't see it.
Squidward: Well, that's too bad, 'cause I found what I was looking for. (runs off with the wallet)
What Zit Tooya: Hey! Come back here! Give me my wallet! (Light turns to "stop" and Squidward runs past a policeman eating a donut)
Officer Johnson: Holy sea cow! That hooligan ran a stop sign. (chases after Squidward)
What Zit Tooya: Stop, thief!
Officer Johnson: You know that guy?
What Zit Tooya: (worried) Hardly. He stole my wallet.
Officer Johnson: What? That makes him a dual offender. Let's get him! (Squidward runs up a ladder to the top of a building. Officer and fish follow him)
Squidward: (laughs) Finally, the moment of truth! Say good-bye to anonymity, Mr...
Officer Johnson: Freeze, thief!
Squidward: No, you don't understand! I only want the wallet for...
What Zit Tooya: We know exactly why you want it, wallet snatcher. (tries not letting go of the wallet)
Squidward: (grunting) This isn't as it seems.
Officer Johnson: That's what you'll be saying in the slammer, punk. (the wallet rips and money falls out. Squidward grabs his license)
Squidward: His driver's license! (laughs) At last! At last! And your name is... Mr. What Zit Tooya? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
What Zit Tooya: It's my ridiculous name! What Zit Tooya!!!!
Officer Johnson: (hits Squidward on the head with his nightstick and Squidward falls down) That's enough of that, ballyhoo. (handcuffs Squidward)
Squidward: But, but, but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong.
Officer Johnson: Tell it to the judge, lawbreaker. (siren blaring as the police car takes off. Cut to the Bikini Bottom Jail)
Squidward: (crosses out a day on his calendar) Only 364 more days and 9 years left until I exchange this concrete tomb for a multi-story ocean liner cruise. (SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk up to Squidward's cell)
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict friend.
Squidward: Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first. So I win. HA! HA! I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!
Mr. Krabs: Enjoy your prize. (hands Squidward the brochure)
Squidward: Woo-hoo-hoo! (dances) Tropical vacation, here I come! (laughs)
Mr. Krabs: Vacation? Who said anything about a vacation?
Squidward: What? In the brochure, it specifically mentions an ocean liner vacation.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you mean that brochure. Well, that was the prize. The brochure. It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know. It's your prize.
Squidward: You mean, no vacation?
Mr. Krabs: Nope, just the brochure. Well, gotta get back to counting me loot. Enjoy your new prize, Squidward.
SpongeBob: See you on the outside in ten years, buddy! (walks off)
Squidward: (laughs maniacally while tearing up the brochure) Oh well, at least I'll have some peace and quiet for the next ten years.
Patrick: (sitting in the same cell) Hey, Squidward. Parcheesi? (Squidward falls apart)

SpongeBob: Got to hurry, Gary. The sooner I get to bed, the sooner I'll get to sleep, and the sooner I get to sleep, the sooner I'll wake up, and the sooner I wake up, ooh ho-ho! The sooner I get to go to work at the best job in the whole wide world: The Krusty Krab! Now, to just put on these sleepy time blinders, before I run excitedly to bed. (trips over a treasure chest. Gary slithers past him and onto his newspaper. SpongeBob finally gets into bed) Well, good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm just going to turn out the lights. (does so) Clickety poo. And close my eyes and go to sleep. (SpongeBob lays in bed awake while Gary is snoring) Just close my eyes and go to sleep. (grunts trying to close his eyes but can't) Maybe if I run around it'll tire me out. (runs around the room then jumps on the bed but breaks it) Oh, I just got to get some sleep! (stand on his head on the floor) There's only one thing for this. (cut to SpongeBob holding a glass of milk) Ah, that's the stuff. A glass of warm snail milk. (drinks it then throws the glass away. Cannot go to sleep yet) Ah, why isn't it working? (falls face first on the ground and goes to sleep. Gary crawls over him. Cut to morning when the clam being smacked by a guppy wakes everyone up. SpongeBob wakes up with drool all over his mouth) Whoa, Gary, what happened? (remembers what time it is and crashes through his front door with all his clothes on except for his left show, which is still in his home) Help, I'm late for work! (checks his pocket watch) Oh, my gosh, only twenty seconds to go! What the...? (sees the bridge ahead is out) Bridge out? (jumps over the gap and continues to run then gasps again after he sees a hopscotch board on the ground where three girls are) Hopscotch! (plays a game of hopscotch perfectly. The three little girls cheer as SpongeBob continues to run) Almost there. (runs in the Krusty Krab and jumps at the time clock with his time slip in hand. The clock turns to 9:01) No!! I'm late. What's Mr. Krabs going to say? (Mr. Krabs is cleaning the door. SpongeBob runs into the kitchen) (thinking) Tardy Pants! You, sir, are a tardy pants! Wait till Mr. Krabs finds out. You better think of something to save your job.
Squidward: One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table number four.
SpongeBob: Order up! (runs to the table) Here you go, sir. One Krabby Patty, Krabby Fries, and Krabby drink in three seconds flat. (smiles at Mr Krabs as he leaps into the kitchen. Customer spills her drink)
Squidward: Spill at table...
SpongeBob: I'm on it. (mopping spill) Nothing a dedicated, on-time employee can't handle. (mops the kids head) Kiddies get a free touch-up. (leaps into the kitchen) Ta-da! All done the job.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: (jumps at Mr. Krabs' feet) No! Please don't throw me out into the street. I am so sorry for what I did to you.
Mr. Krabs: What'd you do?
SpongeBob: I was a minute late for work.
Mr. Krabs: A minute late?
SpongeBob: A whole sixty seconds.
Mr. Krabs: Well, uh, don't do it again.
SpongeBob: No, no! You have to punish me.
Mr. Krabs: What? Okay, uh, then wipe down the salad bar.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Krabs: (walks out of the Krusty Krab) And good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I love it here, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh.
Squidward: If you love it so much, why don't you just live here? (chuckling. Cut to SpongeBob straining to get his feet through a cardboard box he's going to sleep in. He gets his feet through the box and uses napkins as a blanket)
SpongeBob: Somethin's not right. What is it? Do I miss my own clock? Maybe it's my own bed. (snaps fingers) Oh, that's it. I'll make the Krusty Krab just like home. What do you say Gary? (Gary is a toilet paper roll with cucumbers for eyes. Cut to next day where Mr Krabs enters the Krusty Krab and sees SpongeBob sleeping in his bed in the dining area)
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?
SpongeBob: SpongeBob reporting for duty, sir.
Mr. Krabs: How long you been here?
SpongeBob: All night, sir.
Mr. Krabs: All night?
SpongeBob: That's right, I'm going to live here from now on, so I'll never ever be tardy pants again.
Mr. Krabs: Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son.
SpongeBob: (gets out a stack of cash from his pocket) Here's my first month's rent.
Mr. Krabs: rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill...
SpongeBob: Already done, sir. (grill is spotless)
Mr. Krabs: Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties...
SpongeBob: Done. (a bunch of Krabby Patties are in the kitchen ready for serving. SpongeBob punches his time card) All that, before we even open up our doors, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess.
SpongeBob: Eww, I guess I could use some freshening up. (ketchup and mustard stains are all over his clothes. Cut to Squidward putting a bucket of dishes on the conveyor belt but the dishwasher stops)
Squidward: Jammed again. (reaches inside to fix it but pokes SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Ooh. Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, I live here now.
Squidward: In the dishwasher?
SpongeBob: No, at the Krusty Krab. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Squidward: SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me. Oh. (imagines falling in a pile of flowers but it's really pots and pans. Mr. Krabs is seeing Squidward making an angel on the floor)
Mr. Krabs: Must be a full moon. (cut to closing time) Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob tardy pants, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home next to me!.
SpongeBob: Won't you miss me living next door, Squidward?
Squidward: (laughing) No. Coming Eugene. (cheers as he walks out the Krusty Krab) Good night's sleep, here I come. (cut to next day where Squidward is talking to a customer) And when I went home at night, guess what?
Customer: He wasn't there?
Squidward: Right! And when I woke up in the morning...
Customer: Can I just get my change?
Squidward: (laughing) He still wasn't there.
Customer: Come on, man, my change.
Squidward: (grabs something out of the register) Here you go.
Customer: Yeah, thanks... (gasps) Oh, real funny, buddy. Two socks and a pair of tighty whities.
Squidward: Socks and... (gasps. socks and underwear are in the register instead of money) What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?
SpongeBob: Well, I had to put them somewhere and my underwear drawer is all filled up with Krabby Patties and the freezer is filled up with my iced snowflake collection. (blocks of snowflakes are in the freezer) So I put the cash from the cash register in the pickle jar.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: (laughs) Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.
SpongeBob: Do you want to know where the mustard is? (Gary is covered in mustard)
Squidward: Ah! Eww. (cut to later) Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor. (sighs. A clothesline of underwear enter the dining area)
SpongeBob: (sings) Laundry song, la-la-la! Sing about your laundry all day long. La-la-la-la laundry song.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces. (customer sees underwear and stops chewing)
SpongeBob: Well, they don't see to mind. (customer takes down a pair of underwear and uses it as a napkin)
Mr. Krabs: Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.
SpongeBob: (chuckles) Aye aye, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangement-- meaning yours-- to interfere with said money spending. (tries opening his office door but can't) What the barnacles? (opens the door slightly to see all of SpongeBob’s stuff in his office) SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?
SpongeBob: It was getting kind of crowded in the kitchen. (squeezes inside the office)So I moved in here.
Mr. Krabs: You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.
SpongeBob: But I'll only be here at night. Please, Mr. Krabs, I won't get in your way. Please!
Mr. Krabs: Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent.
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr... (doorbell rings. SpongeBob gasps) My parents!
Mr. Krabs: Your parents?
SpongeBob: (opens up front doors) Mom! Dad! Come on in. (enters Mr. Krabs' office) And this is the guest room. Mom, Dad, Mr. Krabs.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, hello. (Mr. Krabs' eye twitches. In the dining area, customers are slipping on snail trail that Gary is leaving on the floor)
SpongeBob: Well, I'll let you two get settled.
Customer #2: Is this your snail?
SpongeBob: (gasps) Gary! Bad boy! No!
Customer #2: Put that thing on a leash.
Mr. Krabs: (holding golden clam-shaped soap containers in his hand) Squidward, who put these fancy smelling soaps in the restroom?
Squidward: The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu. (shows both items)
Mr. Krabs: (gasps) Argh. (walks to his office) That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer. (rips curtains down to reveal Mrs. SquarePants taking a shower)
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know... (walks backwards into Mr. SquarePants)
Mr. SquarePants: What's going on in here?!
Mr. Krabs: No, I... (thrown out of his office. Hears buzzing in the kitchen) What the...?
Patrick: (walks out of the kitchen) Thanks, SpongeBob. (points to his lower back) If I could reach it, I'd do it myself. (all the customers run out in disgust)
Mr. Krabs: Me customers! (cries...) Gone! Gone! Gone!! All they wanted... was to give me...their money. (strained cries...) SpongeBob! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out. (SpongeBob is shaving in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Squidward is about to relax in his lawn chair when a moving truck drives up)
Squidward: What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs kicked me out, so now we're neighbors again. Hey, my drums! (plays the drums frantically. Squidward yells. Cut to next day where Mr. Krabs opens up the Krusty Krab but, this time, all of Squidward's stuff is inside)
Mr. Krabs: Squidward!!!!

Narrator: It is a cold and windy day. Bikini Bottom is covered in goosebumps.
Squidward: Oh, it's freezing in here.
SpongeBob: Not if you get up and exercise! Hup, two. Hup, two. Yes, sir, my buns are nice and toasty. (turns around to show two Krabby Patties on his behind)
Squidward: I'm so glad I don't eat here. (SpongeBob and Squidward shiver as a gusty wind blows through again)
Squidward: Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway? (looks at the thermostat) 62 degrees? Oh, that cheapskate! I'm gonna set it to a toasty 63. (turns it to 63 but an alarm goes off)

Mr. Krabs: Huh? (busts down his door; roaring in outrage) WHO TOUCHED ME THERMOSTAT!? (everyone, including SpongeBob, points at Squidward)
Squidward: (at SpongeBob) Oh, thanks a... (Mr. Krabs grabs him by the nose)
SpongeBob: You're welcome, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you're always goin' on about your book club. Read this.
Squidward: (reads sign above thermostat) "Do Not Touch Thermostat. Ever!!" (Mr. Krabs puts the temperature back on 62 degrees)
Mr. Krabs: Heat costs money! There's two ways to get on me bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat.
Squidward: That's totally selfish!
SpongeBob: Yeah, your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now.
Mr. Krabs: What? (kids are playing ball, playing tag, flying kites, and jumping rope in Mr. Krabs' front yard) Hey, you kids get off of my lawn. (Mr. Krabs runs out of the restaurant. Plankton is watching all of this through a straw)
Plankton: That's right, run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business, and I'll do it with your precious thermostat! (laughs maniacally until an alarm goes off) What the...? Oh, no. Code red! Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Ah! (an old fish sucks Plankton through the straw and into his belly) No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge. (laughs maniacally. It's now closing time)
Squidward: I'm gonna go recover from hypothermia.
SpongeBob: Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?
Mr. Krabs: It means he's a big fat cry baby.
Old Fish: (flushes the toilet and walks to the doors but can't get out) Locked in again.
Plankton: That crusty old barnacle might keep me from his secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place. (turns on sink faucet) Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs. It's just business. (opens up the freezer) Well, maybe it is personal. (turns down the thermostat) I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat!

(cut to Mr. Krabs' house where he is sleeping)

Mr. Krabs: No, no! Someone... touching... thermostat. (cut to next day with Squidward and SpongeBob walking to work)
Squidward: Oh, I meant to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.
SpongeBob: That's why I wore mittens. (wearing a mitten on each eyelash) Mmm. Toasty.
Squidward: Huh? (Krusty Krab is frozen)
Mr. Krabs: Morning, boys. Lock's a bit sticky this morning. (opens doors to see the whole place frozen) Is it cold in here or is it just me? Well, get to work. (goes into his office)
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. (slips and slides all over the place, including into Squidward) Whoa! Whoa! Pardon me. (Squidward slides into Mr. Krabs)
Mr. Krabs: All right, quit clowning around and get to work.
SpongeBob: Yes sir.
Squidward: As soon as you turn the heat up.
Mr. Krabs: The temperature stays at 62 degrees.
Squidward: There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!
Mr. Krabs: I don't care if Santee Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones! Don't... touch... THE THERMOSTAT! (icicles from the ceiling break off and fall)
Plankton: (spying through his telescope) I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder. (customers are waiting for food but Squidward can't move with a tray of burgers in his hand or he will fall)
Old Fish: What's taking so long?

Mr. Krabs: Quit your lollygaggin' and get a move on. (slips and falls, tossing the patties off the plate)
Squidward: Order up.
Customers: Let's get out of here. Yeah, let's go.
Plankton: Yes, flee that frozen wasteland. Warmth and joy have left your lives. (his giant telescope looks at a fish walking by) Hey, buddy, you wanna eat the Chum Bucket? (fish runs off screaming) Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back. (customers are walking into the Krusty Krab with warmer clothes on) I don't understand. What's bringing them back? (SpongeBob is skating on frozen patties) What the...?
Mr. Krabs: Just put those patties back when you're done.
SpongeBob: Can do, Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: I'm really glad I don't eat here.
SpongeBob: Order up!
Customer #2: Where's my food? (patty enters his mouth) Mmm. (patties enter everyone else's mouth)
Old Fish: I want my krabby flabby!

SpongeBob: Coming right up, sir. Ow, ow!

Old Fish: Delicious!

Customers: Yay!

Customer #3: Wow, that looks like fun. I'll have two krabby patties? But don't cook them.

Customer #4: I'll have two frozen krabby patties too.

SpongeBob: Yes sir.

Customer #5: I want patty skates.

Customer #6: I need two patties now.

Mr. Krabs: It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook 'em. This is the happiest and most effective day of me whole life.

Plankton: No! How is this possible? I freeze his place solid and he turns it into an ice rink. He's making more money than ever.
Karen: That's because, unlike you, he's a good business man.
Plankton: Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings.
Karen: I don't understand why you don't just steal a Krabby Patty in all that confusion.
Plankton: I'll be right back. (chuckles)
Karen: (sighs) I don't know why I encourage him. (inside the Krusty Krab, people are ice skating, playing hockey, and riding in the clamboni)
Mr. Krabs: This is fantastic. The local hockey team is payin' me to practice here.
SpongeBob: Coming through! (skates by Patrick, who has his tongue stuck to a pole) Hi, Patrick.
Patrick: (mumbles) Hi, SpongeBob. (Gary, dressed as a referee, blows his whistle and throws the patty in the air. It hits the ground buts slides towards the door)
Hockey Player: Where'd the puck go? (SpongeBob squints his eyes to see Plankton carrying the patty)
SpongeBob: Holy shrimp! Plankton! (yells)
Plankton: I did it. I've finally got a Krabby Patty. (SpongeBob puts his spatula down to block Plankton)
SpongeBob: Not quite, Plankton. You'll have to get past me, first.
Hockey Player: There's the puck. That little square guy has it.
Teammate: Get him. (SpongeBob tries to scurry but the hockey team tackles him. The other hockey player slapsticks the patty)
SpongeBob: Yikes! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! You're mine now, Plankton! (patty flies into his face) You won't get away with this, Plankton.
Plankton: Hey, SpongeBob, long time no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?
SpongeBob: Oh, my weekend was fabulous. Thank you for asking. Patrick and I went jellyfishing but I lost my net. Ha, so, I tried to borrow one from Squidward, but he didn't have one. And then when he yelled at me, he swallowed a bug. (laughs) Swallowed a bug.
Plankton: Fascinating. Well, I gotta go. (takes patty and runs)
SpongeBob: Hey!
Plankton: Better luck next time, SpongeBob.
Hockey Player #2: There's the puck, eh? Get it.
Plankton: Uh-oh. (runs again, this time, going to the other side) Whoa! Whoa! Ah! (Squidward skates by and dances in a yellow leotard. SpongeBob skates by him, he gets angry. The hockey team skates by him and runs him over) Ow.
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, Mister. (two hockey players run into SpongeBob. Plankton tries running away again but gets hit by a hockey stick again. SpongeBob tries to get the patty but is getting hit by the hockey team over and over. Squidward is getting run over by everyone. Plankton gets hit towards the door) Huh? 
Plankton: Phew. Yes, I'm gonna make it. (lands in front of the door but when the hockey team and SpongeBob collide with each other, it sends Plankton and the patty into the air then back down)
SpongeBob: Gotcha, Plankton.
Plankton: On the contrary. It is I who has you. (rides the clamboni)
SpongeBob: (gasps) The clamboni! Run for it! (the clamboni runs into him, carrying him along)
Plankton: (laughing maniacally) Run, you fools. Run! (Plankton manages to take along the entire hockey team, SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick on the clamboni) It's working. I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty. (clamobni stops because of a huge pile up at the door)

Crowd: Ah, ah!

Plankton: Come on, get out of the way! You're blocking the exit. (clamboni shuts down) No! No! (cries)
Mr. Krabs: I'll take that. (grabs patty) Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Um, thank you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: (jumps off the clamboni) You lose again, Plankton.
Plankton: I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon. (jumps on the thermostat) The thermostat!
Mr. Krabs: Thermostat?
Plankton: That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze the Krusty Krab. (rips off the paper that says "62º" to "-15 degrees") See?
Mr. Krabs: (gasps) You've gone too far this time, Plankton. You can pound me employees, (punches SpongeBob in the gut) try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat. (boxing bell rings as Mr. Krabs hurries over to Plankton but Plankton changes the thermostat to above boiling, making the ice melt. Mr. Krabs drops into the water. Then Plankton turns it back to below freezing, which causes Mr. Krabs to freeze, too)
Plankton: See, Krabs, you can't defeat me. (turns the thermostat to hot and cold, making everyone freeze. Accidentally lets go of the thermostat when it's hot and drops into some water. Mr. Krabs walks up to the thermostat and changes it to freezing to freeze Plankton. Cut to later in the day where the ice rink has turned into a swimming pool for customers)
SpongeBob: Here's your Krabby Patty and lemonade, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, lad. (sees Plankton in one of the ice cubes) Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab. Hey, you got any more good ideas? (takes a sip of his drink. Plankton screams)

SpongeBob: (reading a story to Gary) And then, the little ugly mollusk ran all the way home... (Patrick busts through the wall with his TV in his hand)
Patrick: SpongeBob, you gotta see this. It's an emergency broadcast on my TV!
TV Announcer: The day you've been waiting for is almost here. That's right. Glove World has a new ride. It's big (roller coaster goes above the water then back down into it) It's fast (two fish are riding a roller coaster so fast, the man flies off of it)
Lady Fish: Harold, no!
TV Announcer: It's painful (roller coaster crashes into the ground, causing an explosion) The "Fiery Fist O' Pain!" Opening tomorrow only at Glove World.
Patrick: Tomorrow! SpongeBob, we gotta get to bed so we can be first in line! (Patrick hangs onto his TV and goes back to his rock. Scene cuts to SpongeBob sleeping)
SpongeBob: Glove World. Roller coaster. First in line. (SpongeBob dreams of him and Patrick at Glove World. When they walk past the popcorn stand, it turns into a maggot stand and smoke fills the air. An employee and a customer both mutate) Excuse me, which way to the Fist O' Pain? (Grim Reaper points to his left. SpongeBob and Patrick float over to the ride. When they get in it, it goes up, above the water. They scream as it goes down. Lightning strikes the tracks and makes the roller coaster fly off the track) In the name of amusement, no...! (SpongeBob and Patrick fall out of the coaster and into graves with their names on the tombstones. A digger that looks like a dragon puts all the dirt back in the hole and seen the word "R.I.P SpongeBob") AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't wanna ride the Fiery Fist O' Pain! (cut to next morning when SpongeBob’s alarm goes off but he didn't sleep the whole night. Patrick appears by his bed)
Patrick: You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?
SpongeBob: NO!!! Well, yeah. It's just that I had a bad dream last night.
Patrick: Really? Me too!
SpongeBob: What was your dream about, Patrick?
Patrick: Oh, look, the bus is here! (runs toward the bus)
SpongeBob: Wait for me, Patrick. (both get on the bus) Whoo! Fiery Fist O' Pain, here we come.
Boy: Yeah, dudes, we're all riding the Fist O' Pain.
Boy #2: I heard somebody rode it and his spine fell out.
Boy: (laughing) Dude, I hope my spine falls out.
Boy #2: (laughing) Yeah, me too.
SpongeBob: Boy, the Fist O' Pain sounds...
Patrick: Really, really scary. I mean fun-ifying. I mean horror-tastic. I mean fun-ible! Fun, really, really fun.
SpongeBob: Yeah, really fun. (bus stops at Glove World and SpongeBob & Patrick get off) That sure looks like fun.
Patrick: Yeah, I can't wait to ride it. (all the passengers on the bus run out and grab SpongeBob & Patrick while cheering)
All: Yes, we're here! Whoo! (SpongeBob & Patrick are carries into a brick wall)
Employee: Tickets, please. (SpongeBob looks in his pockets but no ticket)
SpongeBob: No ticket. I must have left it at home.
Patrick: I swallowed my ticket.
SpongeBob: I guess we're not gonna be riding the Fist O' Pain today.
Employee: Hold on a second, there's your tickets in your back pockets. (grabs them both)
SpongeBob: Oh, barnacles. (cut to later when SpongeBob and Patrick are walking around the amusement park) It sure was lucky we found our tickets.
Patrick: Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
SpongeBob: There it is. The line looks awfully long.
Patrick: Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
SpongeBob: Yeah, and then the Fist O' Pain will seem even cooler. (both run off)
Patrick: Phew.
SpongeBob: Can you believe some people are afraid to ride roller coasters?
Patrick: Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Patrick. It's Glovey Glove! (a giant glove costume is standing in front of them) Get over there and I'll take your picture with him. (Patrick moves a few steps into the camera so he's not too close to Glovey Glove) Get closer, Patrick.
Patrick: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Come on, closer. (Patrick moves a little closer) That's it, a little more. Now hold onto his thumb. Give me a big smile. (takes the picture)
Patrick: How do I look? (pictures shows Patrick touching Glovey Glove with only a finger) Wow, I look great. (a little kid is laughing on one of the kiddie rides)
SpongeBob & Patrick: The Mitten!
SpongeBob: (clears throat) I mean, The Mitten.
Patrick: That ride's for babies.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Let's ride it just to see how baby-fied it is. (both walk over and get into the ride, with the little kid. When they go over a bump, they scream. When the ride is over, they get out and both are shivering)
Patrick: I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. (cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in line by the Fiery Fist O' Pain)
SpongeBob: Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? (both chuckle nervously)
Patrick: Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters. (an old fish is wheel chaired out of Glove World)
Old Man Jenkins: Oh why, why, why? (SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run off) Why won't you let me on the ride?
Employee #2: Sir, you have a serious medical condition.
Old Man Jenkins: But it's my birthday! (cut to SpongeBob and Patrick running through a line, cheering)
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob & Patrick: One more time!
Tom: You know, this is the line for the bathroom.
SpongeBob: (laughs) We've gone eight times.
Patrick: And I went three times all by myself.
Tom: I'm going to walk away now. (does so)
SpongeBob: Bye.
Patrick: Have fun! (Larry walks up)
Larry: SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob: Hello, Larry.
Larry: I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush. (sniffs his armpit then sighs in relief as a green odor is released from under his arm) You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline. (SpongeBob and Patrick's eyebrows disintegrate)
SpongeBob: Oh, it's, uh... (holding breath) very manly, Larry.
Larry: (picks up SpongeBob and smells him) SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?
SpongeBob: Um, I have a confession to make. We haven't gone on the ride because I'm... hungry. I'm very hungry. Hungry, hungry! (runs off)
Larry: Come on, Patrick. You and me, pal?
Patrick: I'm hungry, too. (runs off)
Larry: Maybe I should stop making people smell me. (cut to SpongeBob and Patrick sitting at a table, eating ice cream, and looking at the explosions on the Fist O' Pain)
Patrick: Want some?
SpongeBob: No thanks, Patrick. Um, you got ice cream in your eyebrows.
Patrick: Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back. (walks off)
SpongeBob: Hurry back so we can go on the ride. (sees the roller coaster drop and plants his face in the table)
Ice Cream: (SpongeBob talks to himself, SpongeBob voices the ice cream) What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, delicious dairy treat, I don't know what to do.
Ice Cream: Patrick's your best friend. You can't let him down.
SpongeBob: I know, but the ride is really scary.
Ice Cream: You wanna see scary? I'll show you scary! (hits himself in the head with the ice cream)
SpongeBob: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ice Cream: You like that? You like that? Huh, you like that? (cut to the bathroom where Patrick is talking to himself in the mirror)
Patrick: It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.
Reflection: No you can't. You're a big crybaby. 
Patrick: Oh, yeah? (punches his reflection, without breaking the glass) I thought we'd settled this the last time! (cut to SpongeBob still hitting himself in the head with the ice cream)
SpongeBob: Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it! Ow, quit it!
Patrick: (runs back) SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
SpongeBob: I have to tell you something too, Patrick.
Man: (over speaker) Attention. Glove World will be closing in five minutes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Five minutes?! (both run over to the ride. An employee comes over and cleans up the ice cream)
Ice Cream: What are you looking at? (cut to the ride)
SpongeBob: (reads the sign) Warning! This ride may cause: screaming, projectile vomiting, amnesia, spine loss, embarrassing accidents, uncontrollable gas...
SpongeBob & Patrick: ...and explosive diarrhea.
SpongeBob: Is that all? 
Patrick: Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.
Man: (over speaker) Last call for the Fiery Fist O' Pain.

SpongeBob: Well, this is it, Pat.
Patrick: Yep. 
SpongeBob: Here we go.
Patrick: Uh-huh.
SpongeBob: On the Fiery Fist O' Pain.
Patrick: After you. (both sit down in the ride)
SpongeBob: We made it.
Patrick: Yeah.
Employee #3: Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times. (buckles them, puts on helmets, and wraps them up) There.
Employee #4: Now if you could just sign this release, involving Glove World in case of accidental spine loss... (SpongeBob signs his name) Well, nice knowing you.
Employee #3: Ready in ten...
SpongeBob: This is it, Patrick.
Employee #3: Nine, eight...
SpongeBob: We made it!
Employee #3: Seven, six...
Patrick: We're not scaredy cats.
Employee #3: Five, four...
SpongeBob: We're not crybabies.
Employee #3: Three, two...
SpongeBob & Patrick: We're brave!
Employee #3: One... (when he presses the 'GO' button, SpongeBob and Patrick scream, but the roller coaster breaks down)
Man: (over speaker) Uh, we're experiencing some technical difficulties.
Employee #3: Man, this cheap thing is always breaking down. Hey, sorry guys. Maybe next time. (SpongeBob and Patrick sigh in relief)
SpongeBob: Patrick, I have a confession to make. I was really scared about going on this ride.
Patrick: Me too.
SpongeBob: I didn't know how to tell you because, well, I didn't want to disappoint you.
Patrick: I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
SpongeBob: But now we don't have to face our fears. The ride is broken.
Patrick: Yeah! (employee comes back)
Employee #3: Oh, wait, it's fine.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Huh?
Employee #3: Have fun.(presses the 'GO' button again. SpongeBob and Patrick take off but their wrapping and helmets have come off)
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't want to face my fears. I'm afraid of them!(when they get to the top, it stops for a moment)Good-bye, Patrick.
Patrick: Good-bye, SpongeBob. (Coaster starts again, dropping and going through a saw, a flaming fist, and a laser. When the coaster drops at a 90 degree angle, SpongeBob and Patrick's skeleton's fly through the air while their bodies go down with the coaster. Their skeleton's fly into them as they go up, out of the water, but when they sit up, they have the other one's skeleton. The coaster drops into the ground, causing an explosion. When the ride is over, SpongeBob & Patrick are holding each other, shaking)
Woman: (over speaker) Please wait until the car has come to a complete stop. And stop crying.
Employee #3: It's over. You can get out now.
SpongeBob & Patrick: We did it! (both get out and run around in circles)
SpongeBob: We conquered our fears!

Patrick: We stopped crying!

SpongeBob: We survived the Fist O' Pain.
Employee #3: Hey, hold it right there. (holds up SpongeBob and Patrick's spines) You forgot these.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Our spines! (grab their spines) Yeah! (when they grab them, they start to wiggle their bodies and then bend them backwards. They laugh)
SpongeBob: Let's go again!
Patrick: Yeah!

(at the Chum Bucket)
Plankton: Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well, at least it's structurally sound. Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.
Karen: Then why don't you fix this rust bucket up? Look around. Chipping paint, bad plumbing, dust bunnies... it's no wonder you don't have any customers.
Plankton: Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul. (cut to outside Chum Bucket where Plankton is dragging a blue paint bucket) Whoa! Whoa! (almost falls in the bucket. Grabs the paintbrush but has difficulty painting the building) I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor. (falls down with the wooden side of the paintbrush in his mouth. Then spits it out and coughs) Ah! This is a job for an imbecile! (Patrick and SpongeBob laughing while playing leapfrog) Or two imbeciles. (laughs) Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to pain The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.
SpongeBob: Aw, well, we can help you, right Patrick?
Patrick: Uh-huh. I came prepared to. (holds up a watermelon and sticks his head in it) Alright, let's do it. (cut to later)
Plankton: Ok, boys, Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Pizzazz, yeah.
Plankton: Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?

SpongeBob & Patrick: Whoa, really?
Plankton: Oh, yes. I need your artistic vision. You wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen, now would you?
SpongeBob & Patrick: No, sir. Uh-uh.
Plankton: Well, hop to it, lads.
SpongeBob & Patrick: (salute) Yes, sir!
Squidward: (listening to music) Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.
Squidward: What the...? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz.
Squidward: Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about that?
Patrick: Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.
SpongeBob: Let's show him. (paint each other)
Squidward: You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now where's the paintbrush? (takes a blue paintbrush) I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes. (paints a little on the building)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Oh. (lightly paint each other)
Squidward: Yeah. Perfect. Simpletons.
Plankton: Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one. (chuckles) My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap.
SpongeBob: Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get a drink?
Plankton: Let me show you something, SpongeBob. (opens doors) I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work, but, alas, my pipes are rusted shut.
SpongeBob: I see what you mean.
Plankton: Yes. If only there was some way I could... Where'd he go?
SpongeBob: (lollygags outside) La-la-la-la-la-la-la. (Plankton laughs as SpongeBob goes into the Krusty Krab basement and takes out some pipes, which causes a leak)
Plankton: (walks up to the Krusty Krab doors) Secret formula, here I come. (opens the door and a bunch of water streams out. Plankton screams)
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
Plankton: Perfect. Huh? (Squidward is painting himself on the Chum Bucket. Plankton climbs up the ladder and jumps on Squidward's head) No! No! No! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush. (takes brush and paints something) Yes, yes, and yes. Voila! (bluegrass music plays as he paints a log cabin)
Squidward: A log cabin?
Plankton: Yeah, I just think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art. (jumps off of Squidward's head)
Squidward: Everyone's a critic.
Plankton: I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with the Krabby Patty secret formula.
SpongeBob: Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from the Krusty Krab.
Plankton: SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?
SpongeBob: I guess I hadn't thought about that.
Patrick: I did. (round window near the ground) Look, Plankton, it's the perfect height for your kind.
Plankton: See, SpongeBob, Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window. (notices window is closed)
Patrick: Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird. (Plankton unscrews a bolt from the window and puts it in between his teeth and grunts. Then breaks the bolt))
Plankton: Can't you two do anything right? I give you one simple task after another and... Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing... life guarding... creative writing... all such bitter failures. (cries)
SpongeBob: Oh, it's ok, little green creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on the Chum Bucket, until it's the most pizzazziest restaurant in Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: (crying) Really?
SpongeBob: And how. Come on, fellas, let's do some interior decorating.
Squidward: Oh, good-bye paint brush, hello antique fitting. Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while. (cut to later,

SpongeBob and Patrick are taking apart the arch on the side of the Krusty Krab)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Hup, hup, hup, hup. (throws arch up and it comes back down on their bodies. They carry it over to the Chum Bucket while Plankton goes to the Krusty Krab)
Plankton: I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home free. (SpongeBob & Patrick take the doors of the Krusty Krab apart and carry them back. Plankton walks inside but when he hides behind a table, SpongeBob & Patrick take that with them. Then Plankton hides in the boat behind the cash register) Where could that stingy crab be? (SpongeBob & Patrick take the boat with them. Plankton laughs as he is hiding behind the grill but SpongeBob & Patrick take the grill the Chum Bucket. Then Plankton goes into Mr. Krabs' office) Still don't see him. (SpongeBob & Patrick take Mr. Krabs' desk. Plankton gasps) The safe! I'm in the clear, baby! (squeezes inside the safe then takes out a lantern and sees the secret formula) It's beautiful. (tears up) No, no tears. Not yet. (takes a deep breath) There's work to be done. (unscrews the bottle top) Ha-ha! At long last! (black and white crowd applauds) And the secret formula is... one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe, travel size. This isn't the secret formula! It's a to-do list. (screams and tears it up. Turns into a little green hulk and busts out of the safe. When he comes out, there is nothing but the safe left) Huh? What happened to the Krusty Krab? Huh? What happened to the Chum Bucket? (Chum Bucket turned into a replica of the Krusty Krab) Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.
SpongeBob: I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs: It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant. (steps out of a taxi with suitcases in hand and a hat on his head)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You've returned from vacation. (the word "Exposition!" appears above SpongeBob’s head)
Mr. Krabs: And it's time for the Krusty Krab to return from it's vacation. (pushes the Krusty Krab over to it's original spot. Then flips it over to have the doors face the street)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: (takes a safe out from his throat) And I bet you tried to steal this, too.
Plankton: (chuckles) Well, steal is such a strong word. (Mr. Krabs grabs him on the side of his eye)
Mr. Krabs: You don't really think I'd leave my secret formula behind when I go on vacation, do you?
Mr. Krabs & Plankton: Now stay away from me restaurant, bug.
Plankton: I think we've been through this one, before. Allow me to do the honors. (throws himself back at the Chum Bucket but doesn't scream like always does) Ah...
Karen: Oh, excellent job, genius. You really fixed the place up.
Plankton: Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day. (cut to later at the Krusty Krab where it's redecorated)
Mr. Krabs: Yup, Squidward, you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?
Squidward: That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs: And these metal decorations?
Squidward: Those were all fabricated from the Chum Bucket walls.
Mr. Krabs: And the computer? (SpongeBob is playing solitaire)
Squidward: Oh, that's Plankton's wife.
Mr. Krabs: Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.
Customer: Wow, $25 for a Krabby Patty? Rip off, dude. Not cool.
Mr. Krabs: But you're paying for enhanced ambiance... dude.
Customer: Well, that's true-- it is pretty classy in here. Gimme four.

SpongeBob: (singing) Someday I'm gonna make you my sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly. Drum solo! (uses spatula as drum sticks) Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga...doo. Doo, doo, doo, doo. Doo. Doo. Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done. (flips all the patties into the air then uses one of his special helmet gadgets to squirt ketchup and mustard on the patties. When the patties fall, they land on a bun that SpongeBob is holding. He then puts the lettuce and tomato and cheese on the patties) In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen such a lovely group of patties. Especially...you. (points to a patty with tomatoes for eyes, a pickle for a nose, and Mayonnaise for a smile) Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you...Patty?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I need that order of six.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Squidward. One, two, and three, and four, and uh... five and six. (only gave Squidward five patties) That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. (laughs)
Squidward: Uh... yeah.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: "That which is fired, must be eaten."
Squidward: SpongeBob, where is that other...oh, there it is. (SpongeBob looks out the kitchen door to see three muscular guys sitting at table, in which two of them are eating patties while the other one does not have one)
Customer: Where's my Krabby Patty?
Squidward: Right here, muscleboy.
Customer: It's about time. (before he takes a bite, the patty sheds a tear)
SpongeBob: (screams and grabs the patty) No! I won't let you do this to Patty.
Squidward: SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby...
SpongeBob: (sitting under the grill) Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved. (opens up the patty) Amazing.
Squidward: (snickering) What are you gonna do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on it? Go out for a romantic walk with it? (snickers)
SpongeBob: Great idea. (runs off)
Squidward: (sighs) I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
SpongeBob: (gives a krabby patty to the customer) Enjoy, sir.
Customer: Can I eat this one? (lifts the top bun off to reveal a shoe in the burger) Hey, how'd they know? I loved grilled shoe. (cut to SpongeBob’s house where Patty is cooking on the grill)
SpongeBob: What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together I feel like we're in our own little world like, like...nothing can hurt us. (small explosion) Fire! (alarm bell rings. SpongeBob pants)Fire! Fire!
Gary: (by a fire extinguisher) Meow. (puts out the fire. SpongeBob stops panting)
SpongeBob: It's ok, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now. (doorbell rings) Oh, I better, uh... get the doorbell. (opens up door)

Patrick: Hey SpongeBob! How about another game of Tie your best Buddy in knots? (Ties SpongeBob in a knot) Okay My turn.

Spongebob: Sorry Patrick. I'm going for a walk with Patty as soon as she dries her hair

Sandy: Hi-yah! (karate chops door open) Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did ya?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
Sandy: Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eatin', SpongeBob. Not for beboppin' all over Timbuktu.
SpongeBob: (sighs) Patty. Yeah, well, you have fun with that. (walks out) Patty and I have to be on our way.
Patrick: I've been replaced by a sandwich! (sobs) Maybe I could make a beautiful sandwich of my own. Yeah! That'll show Spongebob!

SpongeBob. (walks off. Cut to SpongeBob dancing with Patty and singing)

[edit]Music: "Oh Baby"
Oh, baby
They may call me a fool
But I can't help our gravitational pull
When I stuff you with cotton candy
It reminds me you're so sweet
when we go riding, it's dandy
The way you hang on to that seat
Ba-ay-ay-by
When I'm with you our love is stronger than glue, wow oh baby
There isn't anything
There's nothing in the world, I wouldn't do for you

Hey let go you patty eaters no get away
hayah-hayah-watha-haya-haya-ta
wa-wawatawa-hayayayayaya!!!
Patty, you ok, sweetums?
I'm so...sorry
I'll never let you out of my sight again
And I'll always keep you out of harm's way...
Oh baby
Our love is so strong
That's why I'm singing this song
Ba-ay-ay-by
Your looks are sweeter than honey
From your pickles to your buns
It ain't even funny

I'm coming for you
Oh No.
Don't worry Patty!
I'll take care of this!
There you go
All better
Oh baby
[edit]After the song
SpongeBob: Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. (cut to Krusty Krab at night)
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Squidward: How should I know? Do I look like an idiot's keeper?
Mr. Krabs: Well... actually... (doors open to SpongeBob in a tux)
SpongeBob: Good day, sir.
Squidward: As if on cue.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?
SpongeBob: Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
Mr. Krabs: A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady? (quietly) By the way, is she rich?
SpongeBob: She's rich in taste.
Squidward: How could you possibly date anyone? I mean look at you. She must be blind.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, a limousine.
SpongeBob: There she is.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can just smell the money already.
SpongeBob: (carrying in Patty) Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town. (walks by a couple eating and they sniff the odor in the air)
Martha: Harold, again?
Harold: Martha, I know what you're thinking. It's not me this time.
Martha: Well, whatever it is, it's disgusting.
Harold: Let's get out of here.
Martha: Yuck.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Squidward... allow me to introduce my date... Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Your date's a Krabby Patty? Me thinks the boy's really lost it.
Squidward: (sniffs the odor in the air) What's that putrid odor?
Mr. Krabs: (sniffs) Oh, it's the Krabby Patty.(We see a closeup shot of the messy patty like we first saw in The Algae's Always Greener) What are you doin' with that rotten piece o' meat, boy?
SpongeBob: This isn't a piece o' meat, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty. (quietly) And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you?
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, boy, no can do.
SpongeBob: Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. (shows a five dollar bill)
Mr. Krabs: What was that? I couldn't hear ya.
SpongeBob: (gets out more money) How about now?
Mr. Krabs: All right, take a seat.
SpongeBob: (gets out a tiny throne seat for Patty) Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen. Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
Squidward: Well, you should know considering the fact that you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods... why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint.
SpongeBob: Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick, is all. Right, wubby-wubby?
Squidward: I'll show you sick. (grabs patty)
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
Squidward: Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is? (closeup view of the gross patty with worms in it)
SpongeBob: Stop it, Squidward. Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty but to me she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
Squidward: Well, I definitely see I can't help the mentally atrophied. Good-bye, Creature.
SpongeBob: Pay you no mind to that, wubby-wubby. I will always love you... (sniffs) Yeah, what is that smell? (gasps) Patty? (drops the krabby patty on the table) What happened to you?
Mr. Krabs: I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love, too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does. (rotten tomatoes fall out of the patty) Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So...I did. do you hear what I'm sayin' to you, boy?
SpongeBob: Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
SpongeBob: I see now. I see what I must do. (jumps up on the table) Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love. (chews it)
Mr. Krabs: Good job, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25 cents for the patty. Employee discount.
SpongeBob:(Almost puking, holding his mouth for a while) Can I get a doggy bag with that?

(Squidward is sleeping)
Patrick: Will you please pass the chips, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh Sorry, Patrick, we're all out.
Patrick: Aw, barnacles! (Squidward begins waking up) What am I gonna do with all this dip? (SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting in chairs beside Squidward's bed)
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Squidward: AHHHHHHHHHHHH! What are you two morons doing?
SpongeBob: Waiting to watch the sunrise...with you.
Squidward: (Holds up a timer that says 3:47 A.M) At 3:47 A.M in the morning?!!
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: In my bedroom?!!!!
SpongeBob: We come here every morning.
Squidward: You sneak into my house every morning?!
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. (Squidward groans)
Patrick: It's our favorite pasttime. (Squidward growls as Patrick holds up a green flag and a #1 glove and waves them around)
SpongeBob: Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. It's all here in this memory book. (points to pictures) Here we are on the 4th of July (Shows them wearing Uncle Sam Hats and fireworks while Squidward is dressed as the Statue of Liberty). And Valentine's Day (Shows them wearing heart hats). Oh, you look so cute on Easter. (Shows them wearing Bunny outfits) (Squidward is groaning angrily) What's wrong Squidward?
Squidward: Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?
SpongeBob & Patrick: (gasp) Story time!
SpongeBob: Can I tell it this time, Squidward? Pretty please? Whenever Squidward sees us, the storm clouds in his brain roll in and a nasty storm rages. So, Squidward's happy gland is forced to take shelter in the recesses of his mind. But the happy gland can't find a recess deep enough, so he gets the flu and has to stay in bed until we leave. (happy gland sneezes) 
Squidward: And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever...
Narrator: 3 hours later...
Squidward: And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again...
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: ...for as long as time shall stand.
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward?
Squidward: What? (sun rises)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ohh...
SpongeBob: Thanks for sharing this moment with us, Squidward.
Squidward: GET OUT!!! (cut to later where Squidward is putting up an electric fence to separate him from the neighbors) Perfect.
SpongeBob: Wow, that's a nice one. Thanks for inviting us to your big fence warming party.
Squidward: (realizes) Oh, of course. Come, take a seat. The picnic's about to start. (cut to later)
SpongeBob: Oh, this is so neat.
Patrick: I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, Sponge... (both are launched over the fence)
Squidward: It worked! Now I'll just turn on the electric fence. (does so) Now, they'll never get back in. (SpongeBob & Patrick land inside the fenced area)
Patrick: Let's do it again.
SpongeBob: Let's do it again.
Patrick: Can we Squidward?
SpongeBob: Huh?
Squidward: What? No! (points to the door) Get out!
SpongeBob: But...
Squidward: No! You're going out this door, right now... (touches the doorknob and gets electrocuted)
SpongeBob: You're not angry at us, are you Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? (Squidward's brain is not storming anymore and has a rainbow over it) Okay then. You look like you need some alone time. We'll be at the petting zoo if you want us.
Squidward: Do they have cute sea horses there?
SpongeBob: Yeah, they're pretty adorable.
Squidward: And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah.
Squidward: Can I come?
SpongeBob & Patrick: Oh...yeah. (cut to a montage of events: Squidward petting a sea horse, riding in a wagon while SpongeBob and Patrick pull him, riding a ferris wheel, and taking pictures in a photo booth. Later, a bus drops them off in front of Squidward's house. Squidward runs inside) Good night, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, did you notice something slightly different about Squidward?
Patrick: Uh, new glasses?
SpongeBob: No, no, I mean, he seems happier.
Squidward: (peeks his head out his bedroom window) Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you! (closes window)
Patrick: He's probably happy about his new glasses. (cut to next day when SpongeBob wakes up to his foghorn alarm. He turns off his alarm but he pokes Squidward's nose instead)
Squidward: Good morning, SpongeBob. Honk! (makes alarm sound at SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing here?
Squidward: You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.
SpongeBob: (laughs) Oh, yeah. I forgot. The new Squidward. (gets out of bed) I guess I'd better get ready for work. (Looks back and Squidward waves to him) Boy, the new Squidward sure is friendly. (SpongeBob reads the newspaper while sipping his coffee. Squidward grabs his coffee cup) (laughs haltingly) The new Squidward sure is helpful. (cut to SpongeBob brushing his teeth) Ah.. Huh?(Squidward is flossing SpongeBob’s teeth) (laughs) The new Squidward sure is hygienic. (SpongeBob and Squidward walk to work together) Boy...the new Squidward sure is chummy. (tries to get away but Squidward sticks back to him) (cut to Krusty Krab) Ah, this is more like it. Just me, my grill, and you, Mister Smiley Face Krabby Patty. No one can come between us. (Squidward squeezes between them)
Squidward: Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Ah! S-S-Squidward! Aren't you supposed to be out front?
Squidward: I wanted to help you work.
SpongeBob: What? Oh, that's silly talk, Squidward. I'm chief fry cook, and we fry cooks are supposed to work alone. And, uh... (pokes his head out the order window) ...we're not supposed to get distracted while we're cooking, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward! (grabs him and brings him out front) Stop distracting SpongeBob and service the customers!
Squidward: (runs to a table, where a family is eating) How are we today? Everything a-okay here?
Tom: What do you mean?
Squidward: How's your meal? Anyone want tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke. (Plops the hat on the child's head)
Kid: Mommy, I'm scared.
Squidward: Who wants a free refill?
Mr. Krabs: (in my office) Did somebody just say "free"? (runs out of his office) What's the problem here?
Kid: (Starting to cry with tears in her eyes) He-he...he asked me if I wanted tartar sauce, and then he gave me a free hat!
Mr. Krabs: Free?! (His eyes dry up) Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up. My customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you don't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob. (SpongeBob comes out of the bathroom and sees Squidward holding a plate of patties)
SpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing here?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties, you see?
SpongeBob: Tsk-tsk-tsk... Oh, these will never do. Besides, it takes years of practice. You'd never be up to it. Sorry. (he is about to throw the patties in the trash when Mr. Krabs comes in)
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing with those patties?
SpongeBob: Oh, these are no good, Mr. Krabs. Squidward made 'em.
Mr. Krabs: They look All right to me.
SpongeBob: But he's not a real fry cook.
Mr. Krabs: He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you. (SpongeBob whimpers and his eyes shrink and fall inside his body. Bubble-wipe to later where both SpongeBob and Squidward are at the grill)
Squidward: (Turns and notices the Employee of the Month pictures on the wall) Wow, SpongeBob! You've been employee of the month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.
SpongeBob: Actually, Squidward, in point of fact, I've been Employee of the Month a gazillion and six times. (giggles) Keep dreaming.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: (races to the dining area) Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What is the meaning of this?! (shows a Krabby Patty)
SpongeBob: What's wrong with it?
Mr. Krabs: (Removes the top bun and lettuce to reveal, made of ketchup and mustard...) A smiley face...with dimples?!
SpongeBob: AAAAHHH!!! Dimples?! It was him! (points to Squidward) New Squidward did it.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward?!
Squidward: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: I have one thing to tell you, Mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do! (SpongeBob gasps) You're now my new employee of the month. (takes his picture. SpongeBob breaks into pieces)
Patrick: (walks in the Krusty Krab with a pink box in his hand) Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know. (SpongeBob doesn't speak or move) No, really, who is it? I don't know.
SpongeBob: (sadly) The guy you're looking for is over there. (points to a crowd of customers and Mr. Krabs cheering and throwing Squidward up into the air with excitement. SpongeBob cries softly)
Patrick: Oh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes?
Patrick: I want you to pull yourself together, ok? And then I want you to...
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm?
Patrick: Help me spell "Squidward". (opens up the pink box to reveal a cake that reads "Congratulations SpongeBob: Employee of the Month")
SpongeBob: Ok. (takes a tube of filling handed to him by Patrick and changes "SpongeBob" to "Squidward")

Patrick: Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house! (Patrick leaves. The customers and Mr. Krabs cheer and march Squidward out of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob stares back sadly. Bubble-wipe to Patrick's house where several partygoers arrive at the party in progress. Inside...)br>

Squidward: (In the middle of a conga line with some customers and Mr. Krabs) Enjoying the party, SpongeBob? (passes by again) How's the cake, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. It's a very okay cake. (sniffles)
Squidward: I love being Employee of the Month.
SpongeBob: (tears in his eyes) Oh, so what if New Squidward is a better cook than you? Doesn't matter. And so what if New Squidward replaced you as Employee of the Month. And so what if New Squidward is pogo dancing with your best friend. (gasp) Pogo dancing with your best friend?! (whimpers then gets angry) Stop! (party stops and partygoers are shocked) Maybe you can take my job, and maybe you can take my place on the Employee of the Month Wall of Fame, but nobody, and I mean nobody, pogo dances with that guy (points to Patrick) but me. Now do yourself a big fat favor and get out, bub! (Squidward leaves in tears and goes over to touch the doorknob on the electric fence, not realizing that it's still on, and gets shocked. At the party, the lights dim while SpongeBob and Patrick pogo dance) You know what, Patrick? Maybe I was a little hard on New Squidward. I mean, he may be a good fry cook and he might have his picture on the wall, but I still have the best friend in the world. (gasp) I know! I'll go apologize! Come on! (he and Patrick bounce over to Squidward's house, where Squidward is still being shocked) Squidward, I just want to tell you that I'm sorry for being so selfish, scolding at you and all. I mean, who cares about cooking and pictures on the wall, and dancing? I mean, we're bigger than that, right? So, if you're willing to let bygones be bygones, then I'm willing to meet you half way. What do you say, buddy? Put 'er there.
Patrick: He's too proud.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll just meet you all the way. Lay one on me, pal. (he tries to high-five Squidward, but when he grabs Squidward's hand he gets shocked, too)
Patrick: H-Hey, I want to dance funny, too! (Patrick puts his hand on SpongeBob's and gets shocked, too. The off/on switch explodes, destroying the electric fence)
Squidward: (his eyes reappear from the shock and he talks normally) SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?!
SpongeBob: (his eyes reappear. SpongeBob is now acting, talking and looking like Squidward) What are you talking about?
Patrick: (likewise) Yeah, what's the big idea? (all talking at once)

(at the Krusty Krab)
SpongeBob: May I help you, sir?
Customer: I'd like that table over by the window. (points to the table behind him where an elderly couple is sitting)
SpongeBob: As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly.
Lady: 97... 98... 99...
Man: Don't rush me, woman!
Customer: Perhaps this will speed up the process. (shows him some money)
SpongeBob: How will that help them chew faster?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the problem?
SpongeBob: No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table.
Customer: Five bucks if I get the table now. (Mr. Krabs kicks out the elderly couple)
Lady: Ow, my hip.
Mr. Krabs: (ties a bib around the customer's neck) Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else.
SpongeBob: Why did you give him the table?
Mr. Krabs: You know what they say: "money talks". (kisses the money)
SpongeBob: I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out? (talking to money) What do you have against old people?
Mr. Krabs: Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.
SpongeBob: Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?
Mr. Krabs: (chuckles) Yeah. Wait a minute...
Squidward: (music begins) What's that music?
SpongeBob: I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing.
Squidward: Oh, great.


Music: "If I Could Talk To Money"

If I could talk to money
How great my life would be
We'd tell each other secrets
All their friends would visit me
I'd bathe in filthy riches
Which is clean enough for me!
Oh, if you could tell me what you want
How happy we would be
We'd surely be the best of friends
We'd never disagree
There wouldn't be a downside
Not one that I could see
If I could talk to money
Come along, sing with me!
Squidward: Uh, no thanks, I got to go.
SpongeBob: I really have to pee.
If I could talk to money
And it could talk to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, 
We'd always be the best of friends
For all eternity
(Mr. Krabs chortles) 
Patrick: (comes out of the bathroom) What did I miss?
Mr. Krabs: Oh... (starts to sing but customers walk away. Cut to later that night at Mr. Krabs' house) Parlez vous Francais? Hable Español? Oo-yay eak-spay ig-pay atin-lay? (uses stethoscope on money) Mm-hmm. (turns on a light over the money) Maybe this will make you talk. Talk! You're being too hard on the little guy. You can talk to me. I'm your friend. (cries) I would give anything to talk to money. Anything! (Flying Dutchman appears)
Flying Dutchman: Anything?
Mr. Krabs: You?
Flying Dutchman: That's right. 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman. I'll grant your wish but it'll cost you. (contract appears in front of Mr. Krabs)
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, my immortal soul. I've heard that speech before. (signs contract)
Flying Dutchman: Wha...? Well, uh, great. But be warned!
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, skip the lecture. I want what's coming to me.

Flying Dutchman: Humph, you're no fun at all, you know that? (gets out some magic dust from his pouch)
Mr. Krabs: Hey, is that pixie dust? (Flying Dutchman throws the dust in his eyes, causing him to scream. Mr. Krabs wakes up) Whew, that was a strange dream.
Money: You think that was a strange dream? I dreamed I was trapped in a prison made of peanut butter.
Mr. Krabs: Who said that?
Money: Down here.
Mr. Krabs: (Looks under his blanket and pulls out a nickel) Hey, it's a nickel. What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?
Nickel: I got stuck in there during your last coin shower. (shudders) I don't want to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs: (takes his wallet and takes out a five-dollar bill) Do you have anything to say to me?
Dollar Bill: Yeah, when was the last time you brushed your teeth?
Mr. Krabs: It worked! I can talk to money. Oh...
Nickel: Please, don't start singing again. (bubble-wipe to the next day, at the Krusty Krab)
Mr. Krabs: (entering) Don't worry, darlings. Soon you'll be rejoined with all your friends. (kisses his money)
Old Lady: Oh, my, why don't you kiss me like that?
Old Man: Don't start.
Squidward: That'll be five dollars. (puts money in register)

Five-Dollar Bill: Hey, dudes.
Money: Run, jump! Jump out! Jump out! (Mr. Krabs closes the register and chuckles)
Mr. Krabs: (opens up his safe) Good morning, my darlings.
Money: Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You're coming home with me.
Money: Yay!
Mr. Krabs: (walks by...) SpongeBob, I did it. I can talk to money. (shows him a bag of money) Go ahead, say hello.
SpongeBob: Hello... money.
Mr. Krabs: (laughs) Oh, aren't they a riot? (walks out of the Krusty Krab)
SpongeBob: I'm starting to worry about Mr. Krabs.
Squidward: I'm worried he just left with my paycheck. (cut to Mr. Krabs' house where he's on the floor with his money)
Mr. Krabs: Now that we're alone, let's tell each other secrets.
One-Dollar: What kind of secrets are you talking about?
Dime: Yeah, we live in a safe.
Money: Yeah!

Mr. Krabs: You have any friends you can invite over?

One-Dollar: Aren't we enough for you?
Dime: Yeah, what's wrong with us?
Money: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: Nothing, nothing. You guys are great. I thought you guys might want some company, you know, to make you happy.
Money: Why don't you ask what would make us happy?
Mr. Krabs: OK, so how can I make you happy?
Money: Spend us!
Mr. Krabs: What?
Dime: We're money. It's in our nature.
One-Dollar: I've been trapped in that safe for eight years. I always wanted to be spent on a fairy princess outfit.
Mr. Krabs: What? No way.
Ten-Dollar: I want to be spent on corn dogs.
Five-Dollar: I want to be spent on diapers.
Money: (talking all at once) Yeah, yeah, me too.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, wait a minute. I am not spending you on corn dogs, diapers, or fairy princess outfits. (cut to the mall)
Clerk: Did you find everything OK?
Mr. Krabs: (dressed up in the outfits that the money were talking about) Unfortunately.
Money: All right! (Mr. Krabs cries)
(SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, and he's wearing a periwinkle purple fairy princess outfit. SpongeBob is also in a diaper and eating a corn dog)
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Lookin' good!
Patrick: (dressed in same outfit but it's green) What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: I don't know. He's acting kind of weird. (cut back to Mr. Krabs' house)
Money: (moaning) Spend us. Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: I can't spend all of you. And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want.
Money: Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed. What did I ever see in you?
Money: Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not listening...
Money: Spend us.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not... (knock on door. Mr. Krabs goes to see who it is and finds...) SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: (back in his everyday clothes) Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane.
Mr. Krabs: (chuckles) Take this bag as far away as possible and bury it. (closes door then nervously chuckles) What have I done? (opens door) Give me that back. (takes the bag of money and closes door again)
SpongeBob: OK Mr. Krabs, glad you're not insane. (bubble-wipe to later. A thunderstorm brews outside)
Mr. Krabs: Dutchman, you cheated me. Take this horrible curse away! I want a refund.
Flying Dutchman: All sales are final from the Flying Dutchman, especially for a selfish shellfish like yourself. Try saying that three times fast. Your soul's going into me fanny pack of despair. (squeals) Now pay up. Huh? (looks into the bag and pulls out a paper) An I.O.U.(I Owe You)?
Mr. Krabs: (Chuckles nervously) Yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already.

Flying Dutchman: What? To who?
Mr. Krabs: To those guys. (points to some monsters beside him)
Monster: We were here first, pops.
Monster #2: We've all got a claim on Krabs’ soul.
Monster: Get to the back of the line.
Mr. Krabs: Now, now, I'm sure we can sort this out. (Flying Dutchman moves to the back of the line behind SpongeBob)
Flying Dutchman: You too, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: He was short five dollars on payday. (Flying Dutchman sighs)

(a book entitled "The Legend of SpongeBob SquarePants" is on a wooden type platform)

Patchy: Ahoy, mateys! Today I be spillin' a tale ye won't soon forget. (book opens and shows a chapter called "SpongeBob vs. The Patty Gadget") It's "SpongeBob SquarePants Vs. The Patty Gadget". (The scene we starts with the Krusty Krab restaurant)

Now, SpongeBob was workin'. 
His eye on the grill 
till he heard a sharp sound 
that gave him a chill.
SpongeBob:

What's going on? 
What could it mean?
Patchy:

Wow, it's a deep-fry 
patty cookin' machine.
(a round, metal machine comes through the doors)

And hiding behind it, 
who do we see? 
None other than Squidward 
and his bad face acne. 
(zoom in on Squidward's zits on his face)

Squidward: Hey!

Mr. Krabs:

What's is this contraption 
you've hauled into me place?
Squidward:

A miracle, a marvel. 
It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace.
Mr. Krabs:

But how are the patties? 
I mean, how do they taste?
Squidward:

I'll let you try one. 
Shove this in your face. 
(hands Mr. Krabs a Krabby Patty)

Mr. Krabs:

I have to admit, 
that patty was yummy. 
Though it sits like a rock 
when it lands in me tummy. 

But I've already got a fry cook 
and he's always on time.
Squidward:

Ah, but this gizmo is faster 
and you won't pay it a dime.
Mr. Krabs:

Your machine sounds delightful. 
But how much does it cost?
Squidward:

Hmm, just fire SpongeBob 
and tell him get lost. 
(SpongeBob is staring from the kitchen window)

Patchy:

The machine wanted his job 
to make SpongeBob quit. 
But SpongeBob didn't like it. 
No, not one bit. 
Pushing his grill, 
SpongeBob burst through the door.
SpongeBob: (pushes the grill out the kitchen)

I challenge your gadget; 
I declare patty war!
Patchy:

With 3 little words, 
Krabs started the show. 
His flag in the air, 
he cried-
Mr. Krabs:

Ready, set, go!
Patchy:

Quick as a flash, 
Squidward pulled the big lever 
and then sat back 
feeling oh, so quite clever. 
SpongeBob, with spatula 
held tight in his fist, 
flung twenty patties, 
not a single one missed. 
(SpongeBob throws twenty patties on the grill)

The crowd was VERY impressed.
Sandy: Wow!

Patchy:

They cheered full of glee. 
All except Patrick, 
who had to go pee. 
(everyone cheers but Patrick, who is wiggling a lot)

Patchy:

A noise and a clatter 
came from the machine, 
and out popped the patties 
in a burst of hot steam. 
The gadget was fast, 
its first batch completed, 
but SpongeBob yelled out-
SpongeBob:

I won't be defeated!
Patchy:

He took in some air. 
SpongeBob swelled his physique. 
And dozens of patties 
filled up in his cheeks. 
(breaths in so hard that a bag of patties flee into his mouth)

He strained and he sweated, 
he summoned his will. 
And shot Krabby Patties 
all on the grill.
Squidward:

Not bad!
Narrator:

Yelled out Squidward.
Squidward:

A really good try. 
But let's see how you do against 
my machine set on high. 
(pulls down the machine lever to set it on high)

Patchy

The gizmo, it shuddered. 
It crackled, it shook! 
And as Squidward laughed:
Squidward:

Ha, ha.
Patchy:

Sandy said-
Sandy:

What a schnook.
Patchy:

But SpongeBob cried out-
SpongeBob:

I won't lose to that thing!
Patchy:

Then he held up two spatulas
and leapt like a spring. 

His hands were a blur, 
the patties went flying. 
He fried up a hundred 
with out even trying. 
Squidward was worried.
SpongeBob couldn't be beat.
Squidward:

I got one last chance, 
I'll turn up the heat!
Patchy :

He struggled and strained 
'till his face turned dark blue. 
Then the lever moved forward 
and broke right in two. 
The gadget buckled and sparked. 
It cracked like a gun. 
So Squidward took off, yelling-
Squidward: (runs out of the Krusty Krab)

Let me know if I won!
Patchy:

Lightning flew from its maw. 
It looked ready to burst. 
But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled...
SpongeBob:

Foul beast, do your worst!
Patchy:

The patties came flying, 
by twos and be threes. 
By dozens, by hundreds, 
oh, it was something to see. 
Aye,that machine, it was fast, 
but SpongeBob was faster. 
He proved to that thing that 
he was its master. 
(patty gadget blows up)

The gadget blew into bits 
and died with a boom. 
The blast was so loud 
that it woke King Neptune. 
(King Neptune is in his bed, asleep, til he hears the boom)

King Neptune: (mumbles) What's that?

(cut back to the Krusty Krab)

Patchy:

It was all over, 
finished and done. 
With his head held up high, 
SpongeBob knew he had won. 
The crowd yelled "Hooray, 
Squidward's name is now mud!" 
But as they were cheering, 
SpongeBob fell with a thud. 
(SpongeBob falls over. The crowd gasps. Cut to a grave, where Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are standing in front of it)

The service was short. 
Tears shed with regret. 
Squidward, it seemed, 
was the one most upset. 
(Squidward sets flowers over the grave and walks away, crying. Then, SpongeBob walks up to the grave)

SpongeBob: Whoo, yeah! (dances cheerfully)

Patchy:

What's that? You thought SpongeBob 
was buried down there? 
They just buried the gadget. 
Ha-ha, this I swear. 
(pan below the dirt where we see the patty gadget underground. Storybook closes)

Well, that ends me tale, 
straight from the book. 
Now I gotta go 
and polish me hook.

(Squidward is putting the finishing touches on a trophy case)
Squidward: Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you. (flashback to him dancing with some other fish) All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple. (flashback to him getting his legs twisted and stretched) Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing. (pulls some hair off his leg) And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...! (runs out of his house and into a bar of bamboo)
Patrick: Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, you got to go lower to win.
Squidward: What? What are you two doing?
SpongeBob: We're limbo dancing to get ready for the dance-a-thon auditions.
Patrick: We're gonna win the trophy.
Squidward: Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going. (shows them the trophy case)
SpongeBob: You built us a trophy case for when we win? (both hug Squidward) Oh, you are a true friend.
Squidward: No, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye. (runs out but runs into the limbo bar again)
Patrick: Ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I think we better raise the bar. (cut to the tryouts where Squidward sits down on the bench)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Hiya, Squidward.

Squidward: Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.
Female: (over loudspeaker) Contestants 51 and 52 to the stage, please.
SpongeBob: We're up, Patrick. Wish us luck, Squidward.
Squidward: Do I know you?
SpongeBob: (laughs) You kidder. Let's go, Patrick.
Squidward: Poor boobs, they don't stand a chance. (laughs)
SpongeBob: Well, see you at the finals tomorrow, Squidward.
Squidward: You actually got in?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Squidward: Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoe-in.
Female: (over loudspeaker) Contestant 53 to the stage, please.
Squidward: Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please. (dances)
Judge: Next.
Squidward: Excuse me?
Judge: You're done. You know, next contestant. You didn't make the cut, sorry, Mac.
Squidward: But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it... (grabs the trophy)
Judge: Hey!
Squidward: But I, hey... (guards kick Squidward out of the building) Unhand me, you brutes. Ah! (cut to Squidward crying into his house and walking into a limbo bar again)
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You're just not getting into the spirit of this thing, Squidward.
Squidward: D'oh, help me up.
SpongeBob: How'd the audition go, Squidward?
Squidward: The audition? My trophy? (cries) I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition. (chuckles) Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.
Patrick: Whoa.
SpongeBob: Impressive. (gasps) Hey, Squidward, would you be our coach for the finals?
Squidward: What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.
Patrick: Like polishing your empty trophy case?
Squidward: Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?
SpongeBob & Patrick: Deal.
Squidward: Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.
Patrick: Ok, here I go. Watch me now. (goes under the limbo stick but gets a cramp before going all the way through) Cramp! (screams and rolls around. Squidward opens the door and Patrick rolls outside)
Squidward: Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and... (turns on some music. SpongeBob wiggles his arms and legs all around the room, laughing. Squidward grabs his arms) Having fun?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes I am.
Squidward: SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art, and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and ply. (SpongeBob and Squidward bend their knees) Relive. (twirl around on their toes) And now grand jet. (Squidward slips on the limbo stick) Where am I? See if I can find the lights. (turns on the light and sees a giant SpongeBob face. Squidward's head is stuck inside SpongeBob’s body. The two start ) Wait a minute. (feels around) This gives me an idea. (Squidward's body is now inside SpongeBob’s) Ready, SpongeBob? A one and a two, and plie. Releve. Grand jete. (A Close Look At SpongeBob's Legs, His Socks, And His Shoes Dancing Squidward's Moves) (SpongeBob’s legs get tangled in a knot) No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.
SpongeBob: How'd you know?
Squidward: Gimme those. (takes SpongeBob’s legs and puts his own legs through SpongeBob’s pants) That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing? (SpongeBob’s arms are in the air wiggling) Why are you moving your arms like that?
SpongeBob: (laughs) I guess they're happy.
Squidward: Grr... hand 'em over. (SpongeBob hands Squidward one of his arms) And the other one, come on. (Squidward breaks off the other one then uses his arms as SpongeBob’s) Ah, now that's more like it.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, with your arms and legs doing all the work, I'm not really doing anything. I think I should help.
Squidward: Are you questioning my leadership.
SpongeBob: Well, I just...
Squidward: Ok, hand it over. (SpongeBob hands his mouth to Squidward)
SpongeBob: You know what, Squidward?
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I think I'm suffering for my art now. (cut to the dance recital where a fish is already dancing) Good gravy. Get a load of the talent here.
Squidward: Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves. (the fish who is dancing falls on his face. The crowd gasps as the judges give him a total score of 5. The next dancer is a whale balancing a ball on its head. The judges' total score is 23.5. The next dancer is a giant sea horse. Then a dancer who can balance coins on his arms while jumping up and down. The judges score him a 29.5.)
SpongeBob: Oh, my goodness. I am honored to be in the presence of such divine talent. (He bows)
Squidward: Quit groveling. Where is your dignity? (His arm pulls SpongeBob up, then slaps him) These losers are here to worship us-- I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.
Female: (over loudspeaker) Now that's what I like to call a hard act to follow. Next up, we have SpongeBob SquarePants.
Fish: Oh, man. I can't wait. I am so stoked on dancing right now.
SpongeBob: Now, before I begin, let me just thank you all for coming out tonight. (Squidward grabs SpongeBob’s mouth)
Squidward: Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking.
(dances)
SpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, the crowd's gone silent.
Squidward: Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.
Fish: What's he doing?
Fish #2: Is he hurt?
Fish #3: I don't know man, but it's hurting my eyes.
Fish #4: I think I'm gonna be sick. (throws up)
SpongeBob: Uh, Squidward?
Squidward: Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see... (gets a knot in his leg) Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (bounces around on the floor while everyone leaves. A fish who was asleep wakes up and is about to walk out the door)
Fish #5: Hey, guys, wait up. Huh? What's this? (sees SpongeBob dancing) That's kind of nice. Hey, guys, come check this out.
Squidward: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Must finish dance... on other... (gets another cramp in the other leg) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward, is this part of the act?
Squidward: AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! The pain! (SpongeBob's limbs pop out as the crowd cheers and throws flowers onto the stage)
Judge #2: By unanimous decision, we have a winner.
Squidward: Mine! (grabs the trophy, pulls it inside SpongeBob's mouth, and hugs it) I won, I won!
Judge #2: Never before have I seen such zest, such joie de vivre.
SpongeBob: Oh, thank you, you're too kind. But I couldn't have done it without a very special someone. (grabs Squidward)
Squidward: Wait, SpongeBob, no! (is pulled out from SpongeBob’s body)
Judge #2: The rules clearly state a single dancer must perform without any further assistance from a partner. Therefore, you're the winner. (hands trophy to coin balancing dancer)
Fish #6: Oh man, the jig's up, Pedro. We're going home. (rips his wig in half and shows a small man inside of it)
Pedro: It's all right, I'll go call a taxi.
Judge #2: Merciful Neptune. Are there any more cheaters?
Fish #7: (takes off the sea horse costume) Ah, crud, we're 2 dancers.

Scottish Octopus: We're 9 dancers, actually. (lifts his kilt up to show 8 little ones around his legs)
Fish #8: (takes a muscle fish out of his pants) Does this count?
Judge #2: Isn't there a single dancer here who is not assisted by a partner?
Judge: Uh, what about number 52 over there? (Patrick is shouting and rolling around on the ground)
Judge #2: Is he alone?
Judge: Well, let me see. (looks inside Patrick's mouth) Why, yes, he is a single dancer.
Judge #2: Oh, well, then. I guess he wins. (Patrick screams some more as everyone else cheers)
SpongeBob: I love your new dance, Patrick.
Patrick: (screams again) Thanks.
Narrator: Epilogue.
Mom: Tommy? I've got a fresh load of laundr-- (screams as she thinks Tommy is having a seizure on the floor) Tommy, oh, oh, dear me, no! (dials 911) Hello, it's an emergency! My son! He's--
Tommy: (scoffs) Mom, calm down. (stops music) I'm just doing "the cramp"!
Mom: (hangs up phone) Oh, oh, you kids and your crazy dance fads. (she laughs and is soon joined by Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward)
Patrick: Hey, everybody, let's all do "the cramp"!
All: Yeah! (Tommy's mom sets up the music. Everybody dances "the cramp" while they scream.)

Squidward: Ok, and would you like any fries with that?

Fish: (turns around to the people behind him) Hey, if I get some Kelp Fries, will you guys share with me?

Jimmy: Do we know you?

Fish: (turns back around to Squidward) I like two orders of fries, please.

Squidward: And two orders of...

Fish: I only said order.

Squidward: I thought you said "two".

Fish: Ok, I'll have two.

Squidward: SpongeBob, order up. (puts ticket inside the kitchen window, which is full of other order tickets. Squidward sighs) Welcome to the Krusty... (all the orders from the window shoot out. Squidward goes into the kitchen) SpongeBob, what in Neptune's... (SpongeBob's body is stiff) SpongeBob? (SpongeBob's hat falls over. Squidward touches his spatula) Well, his spatula's still warm. (pokes his eye) Well, SpongeBob, I must admit this is strange behavior...even for you.

Mr. Krabs: (enters kitchen) Ahoy, Squidward. (notices SpongeBob) Good Neptune!! SpongeBob, what's happened to you, son?

Squidward: I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.

Mr. Krabs: No, Squidward, this is worse. He's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once me-self, back in me service days. (shakes SpongeBob) What is it, lad? Quick, hurry up, we're losin' money or I won't have enough money to go on vacation. It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he's circled today's date. (reads date) "Important Food Critic Visit Krusty Krab."

Squidward: That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say. (both Mr Krabs and SpongeBob are quivering.) I rest my case. (At the Krusty Krab doors, a round, purple fish with an afro, a mustache, and glasses enters. He sniffs the air in the Krusty Krab) Hey, in or out, mister. You're letting out the A.C. (fish stares at Squidward) Weirdo.

Mr. Krabs: Why hello. You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't ya? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine... (Gene Scallop walks away)

Squidward: Well, do you wanna order something or do you just wanna block my reading light?

Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop. Don't you know our lives depend on his review?

Squidward: Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00. (Mr. Krabs walks over to Gene Scallop)

Mr. Krabs: M- Mr. Scallop, wait, please. Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. (spits while trying to say something) Complimentary! (cut to SpongeBob squirting mustard on Mr. Scallop's patty then putting on the bun) Ok, SpongeBob, that'll be all. (SpongeBob lifts up his hat then puts it back down and leaves) He's nobody. (Gene takes the krabby patty and eats it then leaves without saying a word) We're doomed! (cut to news on TV as cats meow and dogs bark)

Barbara: And there were no survivors.

Bob: Thank you, Barbara.

Squidward: She is so tacky.

Bob: And now it's time for "Bottom Feeding" with Gene Scallop.

Mr. Krabs: Turn it up, Squidward. (does so)

Gene Scallop: Thank you, Bob. This week, I visited...

Bob: You're welcome, Gene.

Gene Scallop: (clears throat) This week I reviewed the Krusty Krab restaurant, the local burger joint that's second to none. Or should I say second to "run" since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.

Barbara: That bad, huh, Gene?

Gene Scallop: Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew south for the winter. I mean, I'm not "kidding" when I saw this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat. (customers smell the aroma)

Bob: And how was the service, Gene?

Gene: You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just "coffin." (two customers are whispering to each other) The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home with me in it. (customer start murmuring and walking out)

Mr. Krabs: Hey, no, wait, wait!

Gene: However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That Sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking! (excited talking as the customers rush to sit down at their tables ready for some food) If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he's Sponge it up. He's Sponge it out, he's over-Sponge it. You can never have too much Sponge. (Mr. Krabs' eyes turn into SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: Well, back to work.

Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay-ay-ay-ay... That's me boy, SpongeBob. That's me boy. (SpongeBob walks into the kitchen as a dollar sign while register dings keep sounding. Cut to a line of fish lined up outside the Krusty Krab)

SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la, la! Wow. (Mr. Krabs is working on putting a new sign called "The Krusty Sponge")

Mr. Krabs: Ok, a little lower, lower...that's perfect.

SpongeBob: Good morning, sir. What's with the sign?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.

SpongeBob: Oh. You mean like when Squidward got that mole taken of his...

Mr. Krabs: Umm... yeah, a little like that. (cut to inside the Krusty Sponge where SpongeBob walks past Squidward, who is dressed in a SpongeBob outfit with a sign behind saying "As Seen On TV")

SpongeBob: Morning, Squidward. Ooh! Squidward, where did you find those shoes? (Squidward is squeaking like a squeaky toy and hissing like a cat.)

Tyler: Hey, it's him! (walks up to Squidward) Mar SquarePants, can I have an autograph?

Squidward: No.

Tyler: (tears appeared in his eyes) But, why?

Squidward: Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms, see? (shakes his arms but accidentally hits Tyler)

Tyler: Ow, Hey, Stop it!

Mr. Krabs: Hey, what's going on over here?

Tyler: He's not the real SpongeBob and he hit me right in the face... just 'cause I wanted his autograph.

Mr. Krabs: Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph...for five bucks.

Tyler: What a rip. (grumbling, murmuring)

Mr. Krabs: Look at these, Squidward! (holds up napkins that has SpongeBob's face on it)

Squidward: Looks like some horrific shroud.

Mr. Krabs: They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent.

Squidward: You really need to see a doctor.

Mr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes. (points to a stack of boxes that says "KK" on them)

Squidward: What's in them?

Mr. Krabs: (takes out a couple bottles that have SpongeBob's face in the middle and red tops) Condiments. We got "Tangy Spongy Sauce" and "Mild Bobby Sauce" for the not-so-daring.

Squidward: Oh, clever. (SpongeBob runs up to Mr. Krabs)

SpongeBob: Captain! My spatula's missing, sir!

Mr. Krabs: I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward. (sticks it into the Squidward's costume's forehead) You're on grill duty now.

Squidward: But that's SpongeBob’s job!

Mr. Krabs: Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him. (cut to SpongeBob as the engineer in the train that is going around the Krusty Krab) Step right up, folks! Take a ride on the Krusty Sponge Fun Train. Tickets are only $1.99. Seat belts not included. (everyone cheers. Cut to the kitchen, where Squidward is looking at the spatula that is on the grill)

Squidward: Ok, how am I going do this now? Umm... (grunts while trying to get the spatula. Hits it with one of the costume arms and hits himself in the forehead sending him back into pots and pans) Mommy, is that you? (outside, SpongeBob is tired riding the train when his legs puft out)

SpongeBob: Ok, Mr. Krabs. I really think I should be getting back to the grill, now.

Mr. Krabs: Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers! (uses the megaphone) Who's ready for another lap? (everyone cheers) Keep on truckin', SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office. (cut to Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, entering Mr. Krabs' office)

Squidward: Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it? (Mr. Krabs is bathing in his money)

Mr. Krabs: No.

Squidward: Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.

Mr. Krabs: Ok. Tell them I'll be right out.

Squidward: Got it. (as he turns around, he hits his head on the top of the door entrance) Ow! Fractured skull!

Mr. Krabs: And let's watch the language, Squidward. (cut to Mr. Krabs signing for the packages)

Mr. Krabs: My pleasure.

Squidward: What the heck is this stuff?

Mr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws... (a green straw with SpongeBob in the middle) coasters, (holds up two coasters with SpongeBob faces on them) bibs... (holds up 2 SpongeBob bibs that say "I Soiled Myself at the Krusty Sponge") And my personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes! (the ice cubes melt) Aww.

Squidward: Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?

Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, Squidward. I'll be in me office if you need me. (walks away. Cut to Squidward flipping a patty and laughing) Whoops! (sets three boxes down on the floor) There you go, Squidward.

Squidward: Now what?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, you're gonna love this. Spongy Patties. (shows a yellow patty with holes in it)

Squidward: Spongy patties?

Mr. Krabs: Yeah. I want you to start using 'em. (tosses one on the grill)

Squidward: Where'd you get them?

Mr. Krabs: They were just the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Gotta keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.

Squidward: You actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?

Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make it $2.98! (shuts the kitchen door. Cut to SpongeBob blowing the horn on the Fun Train but really tired)

SpongeBob: All aboard. (his legs puft down)

Nathaniel Peterson: Hey, we didn't paid $3.00 just to watch you take a nap.

Sally Peterson: That's the worst SpongeBob costume I've ever seen.

All: (chanting angrily) Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride! (SpongeBob sneaks away and takes the statue of himself (where Billy is having a picture by Harold) and puts it in his seat of the Fun Train then squeezes through the doors of the Krusty Krab) SpongeBob: Oh, boy. What a day. What's next? A zombie invasion? (screams after seeing Sadie Rechid, Tina, Buddy, Sandals, Jimmy, Frank walking around like zombies) Mr Krabs, open up! We're being attacked by a bunch of zombies that look like me.

Mr. Krabs: Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.

SpongeBob: Please, you don't understand! They're all splotchy and yellow with distended bellies. (screams as the spongfied customers walk towards him) Open up, open up, open up, open up. (bangs on the door hard enough to where it collapses on the floor)

Mr. Krabs: Who? (Mr. Krabs is dresses in a nice shirt with the money in the chair across from him)

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?

Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob... (gasps) Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies... they're here to eat me money. (tries to go back into his office but SpongeBob grabs him)

SpongeBob: Wait! They're not zombies, Mr. Krabs. They're your customers... Look! (two fish are sitting at the table. One is yellow spotted and the other one is normal looking)

Sandals: Ohh... I ate this yellow Krabby Patty and now I feel sick.

Baliff: Krabby Patty? (takes a bite and spits it out then walks up to Mr. Krabs) Man, you've got some serious problems. If you're trying to pass that off as a Krabby Patty...

Mr. Krabs: It's a... it's a Spongy Patty. (Baliff turns yellow and spotted)

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what have you done? You poisoned all these people, which means you're killing them what makes them dead!

Mr. Krabs: No! But... I just-just... I can explain, I... (Mr. Krabs looks down at his wrists because they are in handcuffs)

Mr. Krabs: What the...?

Baliff: (shows his police badge) Tell it to the judge, Krabs. (cut to the courtroom)

Guard: Calling the courtroom to attention in the case of "People of Bikini Bottom vs. Mr. Krabs". The honorable Judge Horace A. Whopper presiding.

Horace: Ahem. Has the jury reached a verdict? (jury is all yellow-spotted. Gene Scallop stands up and is yellow-spotted, too)

Gene Scallop: We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene A. Krabs, guilty of all charges.

Horace: Very well. Does the defendant have anything to say before we send him down the river?

Mr. Krabs: No, your honor.

Horace: Very well. (bangs the SpongeBob gavel down. When he does, it whines)

Mr. Krabs: Eh, hang on a second, there, judge. That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?

Horace: Oh, why, yes. It's my prized possession. I am a huge SpongeBob fan.

Mr. Krabs: Permission to approach the bench, your honor! (cut to a patty being flipped on the grill)

SpongeBob: Sure is good to be back behind the grill where I belong, Mr. Krabs.

Mr. Krabs: It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position. (outside, Squidward, still in the SpongeBob costume, is giving the judge a ride on the Fun Train. The judge has a whip in his hand) Take him around as many times as you like.

Horace: I just might have to take you up on that. (winks and cracks his whip so Squidward goes faster)

Mr. Krabs: (laughs) I love a happy ending.

(The first shot shows the whole town of Bikini Bottom. Pan in to show Patrick at a comic store, moved to tears by the comic, causing quite a ruckus.)

Patrick: Ah!!! No!!! No!!!

(He stops crying and starts cheering loudly.)
Patrick: Yay!!! Ha Ha!!! Ha Ha!!!
Fish #1: If only "Inaudible Lad" were here right now.
Patrick: Oh.
(He gobbles down the comic book.)
Patrick: Nothing satisfies like a good story.
(SpongeBob walks up to Patrick with a pile of 20-40 comic books. But Patrick can't see SpongeBob.)
SpongeBob: Are you ready to go, Patrick?
Patrick: Ahh! Get back! I wasn't gonna eat all of you!
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me!
Patrick: Sponge-!!!
(He is cut off by a loud belch. An advertisement from the comic book blows onto SpongeBob's face.)
SpongeBob: What's this?
Patrick: Whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it.

(He looks it over.)
Patrick: Hmm... SpongeBob!!! What do all these words say?
SpongeBob: It's an ad! (Reading) "Dear comic book reader..."
Patrick: That's me!!!
SpongeBob: ..."Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?"...
Patrick: I've never thought about anything!
SpongeBob: ..."Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!" Can we go, now? My arms are getting tired.
Patrick: I wanna send in my poem and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
SpongeBob: You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all. Only their clothes. Plus, you don't have $100.
(His wallet falls out of his back pants pocket, and he struggles to reach for it with his legs.)
SpongeBob: Patrick, could you get my wallet?
(Patrick picks it up.)
Patrick: Hey, look, I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record!
SpongeBob: Hey, that's my comic book money!
Patrick: It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants! I've learned to trust signs like that.
SpongeBob: (As Patrick walks away) Patrick!
Comic Book Shopkeeper: Hey, you gonna pay for those comics?
(SpongeBob's arms pop off from the weight of the comics.)
SpongeBob: No. (Cut outside where we see SpongeBob being kicked out of the "Near Mint Comic Books" store.) Can I have my arms back?
(Cut to Patrick standing outside SpongeBob's pineapple house, talking to him.)
Patrick: I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob. For I am about to erupt with masterpiece!
SpongeBob: Good luck!
(Patrick leaves and SpongeBob shuts the door. Then, the doorbell rings.)
SpongeBob: Coming!
(Patrick opens the door, crushing SpongeBob behind it.)
Patrick: SpongeBob! Can I borrow a pencil, and a piece of paper, and a place to work?(cut to other room) SpongeBob, this pencil is broken! Why won't it make words!?

SpongeBob: You have to think of the words yourself.

Patrick: I think I wrote a poem once... (cut to flashback to a younger smiling Patrick) A poem by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom. (swallows paper and bows)

Gym teacher: (Glaring) How many times do I have to tell ya Patrick, this is gym class?! (blows whistle. Young Patrick ducks as he gets pelted with Dodge balls)

Patrick: Dodge balls. (SpongeBob opens the door, walks in with what looks like a dodge ball)

SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick!

Patrick: (screams) Don't hit me with that dodge ball! (light turns on, pan over to see SpongeBob holding Gary)

SpongeBob: Why would I hit you with a Dodge ball?

Patrick: I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.

SpongeBob: (gasps) No!

Patrick: It gets worse, When I read it to the class, the pelted me with dodge balls, just because we were playing dodge ball! Why! (cries, scary music plays, SpongeBob takes needle off record)

SpongeBob: You can play your records later, Gary. Is that why you've been having trouble writing?

Patrick: I'm afraid my poem's not gonna be any good and you'll pelt me with dodge balls.

SpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodge ball, do you, Gary?

Gary: Meow.

Patrick: I'm going to write this poem, I'm even gonna use my brain!

SpongeBob: Good thinking, Pat. I'll open a window.

Patrick: (strains on his brain) Come on, work you stupid brain! Work! Work! (grunting, gears start turning inside his head) It's working (starts writing, smoke comes out of the window)

SpongeBob: Patrick don't strain yourself!

Squidward: Now what's going on? (nose shrivels up) What is that horrible smell? (SpongeBob walks outside) Is Patrick thinking again? (Patrick sticks head out window)

Patrick: I'm making art!!!

Squidward: Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died!

Patrick: That's the creative progress at work. (Squidward shuts window) Ready to go to the post office? (shows envelope full of something rotten, watery and bad) I want to mail in my masterpiece.

Narrator: The next day...(cut to Bigshot records)

Singer #1: ...(Singing) and that's why you're my cookie wooky teddy bear.(music stops)

Singer #2: I hate my life.

Singer #3: I hate your life, too.

Manager: People, we've got 17 more songs to finish this hour! The next one is "I Wrote This" by Patrick Star. (vomits a little, band member takes paper)

Singer #4: This one's really bad! It made my eyeballs throw up.

Singer #1: Oh yeah? (eyeballs explode)

Manager: I don't care how awful his poem is; We spent his hundred bucks already!!!

Singer #1: C'mon guys, we're gonna do this if it kills us. And a one, and a two, and a... (cut to band's funeral. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Fish #1 are there.)

Fish #1: They wanted you to have this. (hands Patrick his song)

Patrick: My song!! Woot!! (Scene cuts to SpongeBob's house)

SpongeBob: Come on let's hear it.

Patrick: Oh I don't know. Can I trust that you won't throw dodgeballs at me?

SpongeBob: I see no dodgeballs here buddy, just an artist and his work.

Patrick: Yeah! And me! Now sit down and get comfortable. (SpongeBob sits down, Patrick pushes in giant amplifier)

SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick?

Patrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you ready to rock?!? Whoo! (Jumps from amplifier)

SpongeBob: Ahhh!

(Patrick lands next to SpongeBob, pushes button on remote, loud music starts)

SpongeBob: It's really loud!!!

Patrick: You want it louder? Okay!!

[edit]Song:I Wrote This
Twinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star
I made myself a sandwich
My mommy named it "Fred"
It tastes like beans and bacon
And smells like it's been dead

Writing stuff is hard,
so I use a pointy pencil
pointy, pointy, pointy,
pointy, pointy, point.
P.U., what's that horrible smell

I have a head, it ends in a point
pointy, pointy, pointy,
pointy, pointy, point

This song is over,
except for this line
You win this round, Broccoli
(house melts, amplifier falls on SpongeBob and Patrick)

Patrick: That was AWSOME! So how was it, did you like it, or did you really like it?

SpongeBob: oh, well Patrick, they're is no easy way to say this..... THAT WAS THE GREATEST SONG I EVER HEARD!

Patrick: You really mean it?

SpongeBob: Yeah, we gotta get that on the radio!(Patrick pulls SpongeBob's arm off) Darn, I just got that arm back. (cut to radio station)

Patrick: Man, I can't Wait to see the look on their face when they hear this!!(someone screams, SpongeBob and Patrick thrown out)

SpongeBob: Did you see the look on his face?

Patrick: Yeah. Did you see his ears?

SpongeBob: I didn't know they could turn inside-out like that. Now how are we gonna get your record on the radio?

Patrick: What record?

SpongeBob: I've got an idea![cut to later where SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof] [wind howls as SpongeBob and Patrick shiver] We just have to play your record from the top of this antenna.

Patrick: Carry me?

SpongeBob: Huh? Patrick-- [Patrick lands on top of SpongeBob and SpongeBob picks him up, struggling]

Patrick: Tally ho! Marsh! Onward and upward! [SpongeBob is struggling to get to the top of the antenna] Faster, SpongeBob! Faster! [Patrick sees a spaceship go by. At last, they were on the top of the antenna. Patrick stands on SpongeBob's face, takes out his record player and then puts it on the top of the antenna but record player wobbles and falls off and Patrick catches it] Oh! Hmm-- This record won't stay put.

SpongeBob: [mumbling to say something]

Patrick: Good idea. [takes out bubble gum and throws it in his mouth and chews on it, while making noises and he blows a bubble]

SpongeBob: [mumbling to say something] [bubble pops and sticks to Patrick's mouth]

Patrick: Oh, yeah. I forgot. [pulls gum off and sticks it to the bottom of the record player and puts it on the top of the antenna and turns on the music] [a fish is walking past a radio in a store]

Eban Schletter on the radio: [singing the poem] Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star--

Fish #1: [screams] [another fish is driving a boat]

Eban Schletter on the radio: (fast forward noise)--I made myself a sandwich, My mommy named it Fred--

Fish #2: [screams] It's in my head! [continues screaming as boat spins around and crashes]

Eban Schletter on the radio: --It tastes like beans and bacon, And smells like it's been dead, [two fish are walking around, listening to music] Writing stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil-- [Fish #3's head disappears]

Fish #4: Lucky.

Eban Schletter on the radio: --Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Point--

Fish #5: [to his girlfriend, Evelyn who are at the beach as the song on the radio plays] This song always makes me think of you.

Eban Schletter on the radio: --P.U., What's that horrible smell?

[Drum solo follows as Evelyn hits her boyfriend, who goes up high] [everyone screams and runs around because of that song. two fish tip the boat over]

Fish #6: Stop!

Eban Schletter on the radio: --I have a head that ends in a Point--

Pilot #1: [covering his ears] My ears! [they pull the controls off and they jump out of the plane with parachutes]

Eban Schletter on the radio: --Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Point-- [the plane lands into the Fireworks Storage and it explodes and fireworks start] --This song is over, Except for this line--

Old Man Jenkins: I like it. [hums the song]

Eban Schletter on the radio: --you win this round, Broccoli! [song ends but begins again. SpongeBob and Patrick see that Bikini Bottom's having a party]

SpongeBob: Well, it looks like Bikini Bottom is throwing a party. and you know what a party needs.

Patrick: Uh, Bean Dip?

SpongeBob: Yes, that is important. but I was thinking about music! Turn it up, Patrick! [Patrick turns the volume up]

Eban Schletter on the radio: It tastes like beans and bacon--

Fred: [covering his ears] Where is that awful song coming from?

Eban Schletter on the radio: --And smells like it's been dead--

Fred: [points to the radio station] To the radio station! [everyone marches angrily to the radio station]

Lou: Torches! Get your torches! [everyone gets a torch]

Pitchfork Vendor: Pitchforks! You can't be an angry mob without pitchforks! [everyone gets a pitchfork]

Cotton Candy Vendor: Cotton Candy! Get your cotton candy! You can't throw a riot without cotton candy."[everyone misses the cotton candy. SpongeBob and Patrick climb down the antenna]

Eban Schletter on the radio: --I have a head that ends in a Point--

SpongeBob: Look at that, Patrick! [the angry mob is coming]

Patrick: Oh, you mean the angry mob with the pitchforks and torches?

SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not an angry mob, Patrick. It's your fan club!

Patrick: Fan club? [song ends as the angry mob chatters indistinctly] Yee-whoo! We should sing them a song!

Fred: Who's responsible for that song on the radio? [SpongeBob and Patrick jump off the roof]

SpongeBob: Why, he's right here. Patrick Star, Musical Genius. [Patrick drones and burps]

Fred: Let's get them, boys! [they start chasing them. they beat them up but SpongeBob and Patrick play with instruments wildly. Patrick plays with a guitar, while SpongeBob plays with a chainsaw and a tambourine. they pant heavily]

Patrick: And that was my new song called-- Arrgh!

Fred: You know, It's not that bad.

Fish #3: Yeah. At least it got that first terrible song out of our heads.

Patrick: Oh, yeah. My song. [strums his guitar] Oh, Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star-- [they hear a whistle blow and it was Patrick's gym teacher from the childhood]

Gym Teacher: PATRICK! Looks like you need another lesson! DODGEBALLS READY! [everyone gets out a dodgeball]

Patrick: Uh-oh. [everyone starts throwing dodgeballs at SpongeBob and Patrick who take cover]

(SpongeBob is crying outside his house)
Patrick: There There, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
SpongeBob: Yes there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days.
Patrick: Two whole days? (cries so hard his eyes come out and tears are falling out of his sockets)
SpongeBob: Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Texas?
Patrick: Texas? (cries more)
SpongeBob: She won't be back for one whole hour, twenty-six minutes, and forty-seven seconds!
Patrick: Oh, forty-seven seconds... (cries) I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles, the way she plays clarinet. (grows Squid's nose) Her massive nose.
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's Squidward. He's not gone, he's right here.
Squidward: (planting flowers) No, I'm not. (walks inside)
SpongeBob: I sure do miss that squirrel. Her karate chopping. That 10-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth? After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know how much we miss her.
Patrick: Is Sandy the one I call "mom"?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties. Patrick, to the tree dome. (Patrick cheers. Cut to Sandy's tree dome where SpongeBob and Patrick are carrying in pieces of wood and some tools. They paint "Welcomandy!" on a sign because they ran out of the room. Patrick tries to blow up a balloon but his head is inside a bowl. SpongeBob points up to the tree and they jump down from it, filling up the balloon with air but they can't touch the ground due to the balloon lifting them up. Cut to SpongeBob putting the finishing touches on a round cake that reads "Welcome Home Sandy!". When he puts down the icing, the cake is gone. Patrick is chewing it but when he takes it out of his mouth, it's in the shape of Texas. Cut to SpongeBob and Patrick lifting up a banner that reads "Welcome Dome Sandy!") We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival which should be in about... whoa, right now! (bus drops off Sandy. Both SpongeBob and Patrick run out to her)
SpongeBob: (singing) Welcome home, Sandy. You know that we missed ya.
Bus Driver: No! No one wants to hear you sing!
Sandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no singing policy.
SpongeBob: That's quite all right, Miss Cheeks. As long as you don't have a fierce "no partyin'" policy. (Sandy laughs) First, cake, then we'll karate chop and then...
Sandy: Wow, guys. You two... uh, really know how to... uh, throw a party. (scratches her neck)
SpongeBob: I knew it! You have been itchin' to see us.
Sandy: Well, something's been making my skin crawl.
SpongeBob: Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off your crawling hide? (cut to SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy sitting at the table) Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return.
Patrick: This is gonna taste so good again.
SpongeBob: Dig in, Sandy.
Sandy: (scratching herself with the fork) Uh... look tasty, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You okay, Sandy?
Sandy: I'm fine. My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air. (she's shedding hair all over the food. SpongeBob pushes his plate away while Patrick combs his hair on his food)
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, Sandy? Sandy? (takes out a present) Surprise, Patrick and I chipped in and got you a little somethin' somethin'.
Sandy: Aw, guys, you shouldn't have. (opens present to reveal a giant clam board) A new itch board... I mean, a new snow bard. Boy, I can't wait to scratch this down Cafe Mountain.
SpongeBob: Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
Sandy: Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.
SpongeBob: Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, are you still up for some karate chops?
Sandy: Yes.... Rashy sore... I mean, sure. (cut to both having their gloves on but Sandy still scratching)
SpongeBob: You ready? (Sandy's grunting) And how about now? You ready?
Sandy: Creeping critters, feels like something's bitin' me. (looks inside her skin to find a bug biting her) I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight. Hi-ya! (karate chops the flea but it jumps into her right leg) I'll get you. Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya! (karate chops and gnawls at her leg) SpongeBob, ah... my suitcase, hurry. I'm ashamed of saying this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea.
SpongeBob: What's a flea?
Sandy: A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. (puts on a spikey collar) But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'. (flea jumps onto SpongeBob’s right hand)
SpongeBob: (laughs) He tickles. Oh, this isn't so bad. (flea bites him) Ow! He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?
Sandy: No, but you can use this one right quick. (takes off her collar and puts it on SpongeBob. The flea jumps onto Patrick and bites a bunch. Patrick screams then laughs at all the red marks he has on his stomach)
Patrick: Connect the dots! (connects his bite marks) I drawn a horsie. Ouch, why does this flea keep biting me?
Sandy: 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites ya, it's cause he's suckin' up your blood for nutrition.
Patrick: I've been bit by a vampire flea! No...! I'm going to turn into a vampire now! It's already happening! (makes noises)
Sandy: Patrick, there ain't no such thing as vampires.
Patrick: Yah, doesn't matter. Oh, this itch is killing me. (takes the collar and wraps it around his waist. The flea jumps onto Sandy)
Sandy: Ah... give me that! (takes the collar and puts it around her neck) Whew. (flea jumps onto SpongeBob and bites him)
SpongeBob: Sandy, please, help me!
Sandy: I need this!
SpongeBob: I need it more! (SpongeBob takes the collar causing the flea to jump to Patrick. Then Patrick grabs the collar causing the flea to jump into Sandy's nose and crawl across her eyes. This goes on for a while until the flea lays an egg on Sandy's head. More flea's emerge and jump on everyone)
Sandy: Enough, I will not take this anymore. (wraps the collar around all three of them) What ya gonna do now, punks? (fleas jump off) Looky, it worked! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
SpongeBob: Um, is that what "over" look like? (points to a pile of fleas)
Sandy:(fleas eat the belt) Run!
SpongeBob & Patrick: Okay. (all three run but the fleas act as a cannon and shoot their own kind at SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy)
Sandy: Ya'll got the aim of a cross-eyed armadillo. (screams) Run again!
SpongeBob & Patrick: Okay. (fleas surround the other three and make their skin puff up)
SpongeBob: Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go. (the fleas block the exit. SpongeBob & Patrick scream until they see Squidward walking down the street)
SpongeBob & Patrick: (muffled) Help! Help!
Squidward: Just ignore them, Squidward and continue your power walk. heel toe, heel toe, heel toe, heel toe.
Sandy: Back off! (steps on fleas but the fleas surround her)
SpongeBob: Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay?
Sandy: (spits out some fleas) Them varmints is tough! They're from Texas! Whew.
Patrick: It's gonna be all right, we will help you. (fleas fly in and SpongeBob and Patrick scream) Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation. All you've brought us is fleas and trouble and pain and itching ...and rash and pain and fleas and itching and ...pain. So much pain! So much pain. (to SpongeBob) And as for you... if you hadn't thrown his surprise party, we wouldn't be in this mess.
SpongeBob: Wait a minute. You had as much to do with this party as I did.
Patrick: You call this a party? I'm beginning to question our friendship.
SpongeBob: Stop smudging my helmet!
Patrick: Oh, I got half a mind, buddy.
Sandy: (shoves them both down) Will you two men stop yelling at each other? What's that gonna prove? If we're gonna get out of this, we gotta work together.
Patrick: You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders. (SpongeBob does so) Uh-huh, good. Now... (grunts) I'll get on top of you. (does so and grabs an apple from the tree and eats it) Ah, much better. (falls to the ground)
Sandy: I do not play games! (flea makes an pieces of eight of cryingness) Quick, get in the tree house. It's the only safe place left. (all three climb to the top of the tree) We should be protected here. (fleas come in through an opening of the tree that acts like a window) Hold on. (throws an acorn at a button named "emergency escape hatch". All three slip through a hole in the board onto the ground. The fleas surround them again)
SpongeBob: Is this how we're going to spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
Patrick: Is this how we're gonna spend the rest of our ducks living in fleas instead of water?
Sandy: SpongeBob, that's it! Water! (puts on a water helmet and karate chops her way through the fleas and opens the door to cause the whole ocean water to come rushing into her dome and the fleas to disappear)
SpongeBob & Patrick: Water! (all the fish and water comes pouring into her dome and causing everyone to be squished inside against the glass)
SpongeBob: (through glass) It sure is good to have you back, Sandy. (cut to treedome exterior with small puddles of water surrounding the treedome)

(Patrick wakes up grunting and moaning with lots of drool all over his mouth)

Patrick: Wha....?? What happened? Where am I? (looks at all the mess that's around the room then chuckles) Oh yeah, the party. I must've passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen... on the ceiling. (falls off the ceiling and into a chair) See, SpongeBob, I told you we shouldn't stay up past 8:30. Things get real crazy after 8:30. (clock shows 8:35 and SpongeBob is playing tea party up in his room)

SpongeBob: Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would? (pours some average tea)

Patrick: Whoo... chamomile, chamomile, chamomile! Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob? (you can hear SpongeBob snoring) SpongeBob... SpongeBob? Sponge... (gasps as we see SpongeBob sleeping with a donut in his hand) That's a good lookin' donut. Wow. (chuckles and tries to run away with it but gets lunged back into SpongeBob) This donut's connected to SpongeBob. Oh... (takes the donut off of SpongeBob's hand) It worked! (chuckles and runs off to his rock with it. Sits at the table with the donut on a plate) A beautiful specimen of donut-hood. A donut this nice deserves to be served on fine china. (opens up his cubbard and all his plates, except for one, fall and break on the floor) The good plate. (takes the plate and goes to the table with it) Don't worry, donut. No longer will you suffer the indignity of sub-par dining wear. I don't think I've ever seen a donut this nice before. (is about to eat it but stops) Except maybe that donut SpongeBob showed me last night. (flashback to last night)

SpongeBob: A donut this nice could really make a guy happy. (passes out on the table behind him. Back to the present time. Patrick gasps) This is SpongeBob's delicious... (puts the donut in his mouth) Wai... I 'ant eat 'is 'onut. (spits it out) It's SpongeBob's. (cries. Then the donut consciousness's appear on Patrick's shoulders)

Red Donut: Go on and eat it. What are you waiting for?

White Donut: Don't do it, it's SpongeBob's donut. Don't listen to him, he's covered in sprinkles. (Patrick cries)

Patrick: I hate conflicts.

Red Donut: It couldn't get any easier than this. Just hook a chain to it, (does so) pop it in your mouth, and then when your sponge friend wants it back just yank it out.

White Donut: I hate to admit it, but that's a great idea. (Patrick eats the donut and chuckles. His stomach rumbles) And now... (takes out the chain but the donut is not on it) SpongeBob's donut, I ate it! (coughs it up and spits it out) I've gotta sneak this back into SpongeBob's house before he... (phone rings. Patrick answers) Hello?

SpongeBob: (on phone) Hey, Patrick.

Patrick: Ah!

SpongeBob: Hey, Star. It's Squarepants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy?

Patrick: Ah!

SpongeBob: That's exactly how I feel about it. Ah! Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again.

Patrick: Ah, don't watch that tape!

SpongeBob: I'm waiting to watch it with you, sillyfish. I'll be right over. (hangs up phone) Sheesh, Patrick's so excited. I better not keep him waiting.

Patrick: Oh, no... that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee! I gotta hide this thing. (tries hiding it under a picture of him and SpongeBob but it slips out. SpongeBob leaves his house and heads towards Patrick's. Patrick tries to hide the donut in the lamp but the light on the ceiling shows the donut's reflection. Patrick takes it out then runs around it before putting it under the rug) Whew. (falls backwards) Oh. (imagines SpongeBob walking in and stepping on the donut)

SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I- (squish) donut! You monster. You monster! (Patrick takes the donut and puts it in the toaster but then imagines SpongeBob again) Nothing goes with a video like toast. Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy. (Patrick screams and takes it out of the toaster)

Patrick: Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow! (throws it in the toilet then imagines SpongeBob again)

SpongeBob: Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go. (takes it out of the toilet)

Patrick: Oh, I know, the attic. (runs up imaginary steps) Wait, I don't have an attic. (falls into his hole) Oh... oh, I know, the attic. (goes up the imaginary steps again and falls)

SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.

Patrick: Ah! H-hey, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: Are you ready to...

Patrick: I don't have anything behind my back, so don't look there. (donut is in the back of his pants)

SpongeBob: Ok, no problem. Ready to see this? (takes out the tape) The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy? (puts the tape in the VCR and about to push play but Patrick stops him)

Patrick: No...! (sobs) I took it, SpongeBob. I took your donut. I'm sorry.

SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, you really need to see this video. (cut to video) I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and a donut this nice could really make a guy happy. (falls over)

Patrick: You mean... (takes out the donut) this is mine?

SpongeBob: Of course, it was your birthday.

Patrick: When?

SpongeBob: Last night, silly.

Patrick: Oh, thanks, buddy. (tears the donut in half) Wanna share it?

SpongeBob: Sure, pal. (both eat their half but SpongeBob begins to stop chewing because of the taste)

Patrick: Pretty good, huh?


(closing time at Krusty Krab as customers walk out)
Mr Krabs: Well, good night folks, come again. (flips the 'open' sign around to 'closed') Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, Spongebob.
Spongebob: (washing plates) There ya go, little buddy. Now everybody's all clean and ready for beddy-bye.
Mr Krabs: (enters kitchen) Time to pack it in, Spongebah...! (sees some food on a plate and screams)
Spongebob: All ready, Mr Krabs. Just gotta clock out and...
Mr Krabs: Spongebob, what's the meaning of this? (shows him the dirty plate)
Spongebob: (screams) Spot, spot, spot!
Mr Krabs: That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...
Spongebob: ...till everything's ship-shaped, sir. Don't worry, Mr Krabs, I'll get this plate cleaned up in a jiffy.
Mr Krabs: Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.
Spongebob: Lock up? Wait, Mr Krabs. Don't you remember what happened last time you left me here alone? (flashback to Krusty Krab on fire)
Mr Krabs: Shoud've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.
Spongebob: Aye-aye, sir. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. (washes the plate but the spot is still on there) You're a tough little guy, aren't ya? (tries to clean it some more but it's not coming off) This means war. (cut to SpongeBob trying to use a jackhammer, a bat, and a chainsaw to get it off but nothing is working) Wait here, please. (goes off and comes back riding a tank) Say good-night, dried on filth. (shoots a pink sponge onto the plate then checks to see if the spot is gone and it's not) That is the last straw! And I want you to remember... (crying) you made me do this. (spits on it and tries to rub it out but nothing happens) I got to finish this. (cut to SpongeBob in an army-like outfit) I'm afraid this isn't the last time we'll be meeting like this, my friend. Allow me to introduce you to... the Spotmaster 6000. (a water- gun laser) Notice, the microwave-powered laser particle beam. Notice, the laser-guided high pressure water cannon. And notice, the little surprise I installed just for you. A specially woven metal alloy ingeniously combined with state of the art cleaning materials. (soap, mop, bucket, and other materials are combined with it) I call it... (pushes a button to show a ball of wool) steel wool. And it comes with...a laser! Any last words? Mmm...I thought not. Power up. (shoots a green laser the spot) Water cannon... on. (turns it on) No effect. Steel wool laster... on! (turns it on. Lights are shining out of the Krusty Krab and Mr Krabs can see it from his home)
Mr Krabs: Hmmm, a strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably nothing to do with Spongebob.
Spongebob: Ok, you asked for it. It may end life as we know it but I am crossing the beams. (does so) More power! (Mr Krabs checks out his window)
Mr Krabs: Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.
Spongebob: More power!
Mr Krabs: (sees a bunch of lasers and lights coming from the Krusty Krab) Oh, boy, this doesn't look good.
Spongebob: More power!
Mr Krabs: Let's see what he's done this time. (puts the key in the lock)
Spongebob: Maximum power! (an explosion the size of an atom bomb occurs. The Spotmaster 6000 disintegrates)
Mr Krabs: Oh, this time, ya done it, boy. What do you got to say for yourself?
Spongebob: (shows Mr Krabs the clean plate) The platter's all clean, Mr Krabs.
Mr Krabs: Oh, I'll clean your platter!(chases Spongebob) Come here, you.

(It is a normal day at the Krusty Krab. Or so everyone thinks. Plankton is disguised as a pepper shaker. He steals a Krabby Patty from a customer)

Plankton: Ha! (He runs out the Krusty Krab. However, Mr. Krabs picks him up from behind)

Mr. Krabs: Hold it right there, Plankton.

Plankton: Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: I'll take that. (Gets the Krabby Patty from him)

Plankton: How'd you know it was me?

Mr. Krabs: Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.

Plankton: Hmm...perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.

Mr. Krabs: You think! SpongeBob! (SpongeBob runs onto the scene)

SpongeBob: Wooo-ooo! (Krabs puts Plankton in his mouth)

Announcer: (off-screen) 3, 2, 1... launch! (SpongeBob launches Plankton up in the air through his hat)

Plankton: AAHH!

(Cut to the park. Plankton is on a bench)

Plankton: Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs's formula! Mr. Krabs is too powerful! If only there were a way to render him helpless!

Sadie: Aww, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.

Plankton: Hey, I resent that! Huh?

(Cuts back to show Sadie with her baby)

Sadie: Why, you're so tiny and helpless that I could take your formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it. (Takes bottle away from baby. He starts to cry until he gets it back)

Plankton: Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerless...baby.

(Cut to Mr. Krabs inside his restaurant)

Mr. Krabs: (A penny catches his eye) Ooh, a penny. (He sees a trail of pennies) A trail of pennies! (They lead him into a phone booth outside.) Plankton: (We see some green gas appear around Mr. Krabs) I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant! (He opens the phone booth, revealing Mr. Krabs as a baby. The key is right beside him) The key to the Krusty Krab. This was easier than I hoped. (Looks at Mr. Krabs) He's a little bigger than I imagined. (Mr. Krabs starts biting him) Whoa! No, no! Ah, ah, ahh! Oof! Whoa! (releases him, but he can't reach for the doors)

SpongeBob: Hey, a baby! What are you doing out here all alone, baby? I'll take charge of you until your mommy shows up! Oh, aren't you just too cute. Coochie-coochie-coo!(Laughs.)

Plankton: Hello! If you're done making a total fool of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.

SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Plankton. Here you go.

Plankton: Yes, my plan is working perfectly, now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty secret formula will be mine! (laughs) Eh? Hello.

SpongeBob: Police! Police!

(cut to the police taking Plankton away in handcuffs, but they're too big to hold him)

Plankton: Fools, you'll never hold me! These primitive shackles are no match for my genius. (jumps out of them) That was easy. I'm free! Free! (police chase him)

SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward. Thank Neptune you're here. I found this baby all alone. But he wasn't really alone, he was with Plankton! And he's not a baby! It's Mr. Krabs! Plankton turned into an infant so he could steal the Krabby Patty formula! What do we do, Squidward?

Squidward: I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break.

(scene cuts to the Chum Bucket)

Plankton: ...and then that sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket. Now I'll never be a tyrranical overlord.

Karen: Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Next time spray SpongeBob too.

Plankton: What?

Karen: Listen carefully. Spray.

Plankton: Yes.

Karen: Sponge.

Plankton: OK.

Karen: Bob.

Plankton:All right.

Karen: Too!

Plankton: Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.

Karen: (sighs) That's just what I...

Plankton:(interuppts) Na, na, I don't want to hear anymore of your loony schemes Karen.(Plankton jumps off chair) I've got work to do! (cuts to Krusty Krab)

SpongeBob: Aw, what's wrong, Mr. Baby Krabs? Are you thirsty? (gives him some milk and he stops crying) That's it, drink up! (Krabs spits the bottle out of his mouth and he continues to cry) Okay, maybe you're hungry? How about a nice hot Krabby Patty? (flicks it away and continues to cry) Yikes, not even a Krabby Patty helps. How about a stack of twenties?

Plankton: (comes in when Mr. Krabs is smelling the money) Hands in the air! (Both obey.)

SpongeBob: Plankton!

Plankton: That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time. (Sprays both, but Mr. Krabs turns into an adult, and SpongeBob turns into a baby) What? SpongeBob's a baby but Krabs is back to normal? (sprays again) It seems a second dose acts as an antidote! One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult! (sprays both of them once, and they come back to normal) Or is it three squirts for baby, and four squirts for adults. Barnacles, I've run out of gas!

Mr. Krabs: Ahem!

Plankton: Krabs! Nice diaper. (Mr. Krabs is about to throw him) Hold on, hold on! (throws him. cut to Plankton flying in the air) Yes, I've got it!

Mr. Krabs: (checking the mailbox) There'd better be something other than bills in here. (Plankton comes out) Plankton!

Plankton: Peek-a-boo!

Mr. Krabs: (running back in the Krusty Krab) Ahh! I can't tolerate your stinky gas!

Dennis: (farts)

Miss Shell: That makes two of us.

Dennis: I don't do it on purpose!

Mr. Krabs: You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Ooh...another penny! Come to papa! Now were we doing?

Plankton: This! (sprays him)

Plankton: What's the matter, baby? You gonna cry? (Mr. Krabs is turned into a senior citizen) What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!

Mr. Krabs: Eh? What was that, sonny?

Plankton: Out of my way, Methusela! You're old and useless. (SpongeBob comes out of nowhere)

SpongeBob: Hold it right there! Old people are out greatest natural resource! I salute you, elder citizenry!

Plankton: I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again! (sprays the gas on SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: I remember when a quarter used to cost a nickel.(laughs weakly)

Plankton: This baby gas is worthless! At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!

SpongeBob: What was that, sonny?

Plankton: It'll take more time to explain than you have left.

SpongeBob: What?

Mr. Krabs: He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!

SpongeBob: Catch who?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, Gesundheit.

Plankton: Victory is mine! (shaken by the sound of walkers)

SpongeBob: Come back here, you little whippersnapper!

Mr. Krabs: You kids get off my lawn! Whew! Ooh, boy. I'll catch up with you, boy!

SpongeBob: I'm catching up with my knitting.

Mr. Krabs: (hatches an idea) That's it! Knit, little nitwit!

Plankton: That was almost too easy. (is caught in a net) No! I demand you geezers release me!

Mr. Krabs: Right after the party. The piñata party.

Plankton: What?

Senior Citizens: That's for calling us old.

Plankton: Hey, quit it!

Citizen: I want candy!

Plankton: No!

(back at the Chum Bucket)

Plankton: (mumbling)Of course! The final ingredient I'm lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just where to get it.

(cut to the Barg'n Mart)

Plankton: Excuse me, what isle did you get that from?

Shubie: You mean the Kelp-O?

Plankton: No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.

Shubie: Are you talking about my baby, creep? (Chases Plankton with her cart. She ends up running over him)

Plankton: Ow, ow, ow! (gasps) Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey, buddy, is this made of real or artificial baby? (The Pink Fish runs over Plankton again)Ow, ow, ow, ow!

Plankton: (Cut to Plankton back in his lab. He is pouring gas into small bombs) That powdered baby did the trick. Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!

Karen:(sarcastically) Just like all your plans that "couldn't possibly fail?"

Plankton: What is it now, Karen?

Karen: I'm saying you should test your gas before you come running there all willy nilly!

Plankton: That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig! (grabs the pack and points it at Karen)

Karen: (gasps) Plankton, don't you dare! (sprays her and a calculator falls to the ground)

Plankton: Karen! Speak to me!

Karen:07734(Hello)

Plankton:It worked!

(cut to the Krusty Krab, where old Mr. Krabs is drinking a soda)

Plankton: Everyone say your ABC's! (sprays two people, who start crying) Now when you turn into babies, you stay babies! (sprays more people) Hey, Krabs, catch! (He turns into a baby. Old SpongeBob comes out of the kitchen)

SpongeBob: What's wrong, little feller? (he is turned into a baby, and both cry)

(cut to a ceiling scene of the Krusty Krab, where there is a chaos. Cut to the bathroom doors, with a baby next to it. Squidward enters, along with a gas bomb. The doors open and he turns into a baby. Patrick is also turned into a baby)

Plankton: My moment of triumph! (slips on drool) What the? Oh, gross! I command you to stop drooling on me!

Mr. Krabs: Goo!

Plankton: (Mr. Krabs grabs Plankton and starts shaking him) Put me down! Stop it! I'm an adult!

(SpongeBob starts biting him. he releases him and he lands in Patrick's diaper. Mr. Krabs is then seen sucking the Krabby Patty secret formula)

Plankton: Huh? I don't believe it! The Krabby Patty Formula! He's teething on it! Give it here, you big stupid baby!

(Mr. Krabs bashes Plankton with the bottle)

Plankton: Ouch! (Baby krabs hits him 2 times) I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from you! (Baby SpongeBob starts playing with the gas) Hey! What are you doing? (the gas releases and it sprays Plankton) Uh-oh.

(Plankton shrinks as the bottle squashed him and now he's inside a gray ameoba field)

Baby Plankton: Ahem! (puts hands over privates) Mama's evil little genius needs a diaper!

SpongeBob: (Starts with scene of The Krusty Krab zooming in, then we see SpongeBob ringing the bell) Order up right now! Go out there, and bless the taste buds of your lucky connoisseur (blows a kiss then a heart pops up and Squidward accidentally swallows it and starts choking)

Squidward: It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!

SpongeBob: Well okay you sit this one out Squidward, this will be a special delivery from the chef. (talking to customer) For your dining pleasure, 2 double Krabby Patties cooked to perfection complimented by a side of coral bits and a jumbo diet soda, topped off with a little extra love. (reaches into his chest and pulls out a heart and sprinkles some of it on the Krabby Patties. He then Pants) Enjoy your meal! (sighs) It's the little details that they really appreciate, isn't it Squidward?

Squidward: (breathes) Oh yeah, you really touched his life. (cuts to scene of customer eating his Krabby Patties like a pig)

SpongeBob: Nothing beats making quality food for good people with discriminating tastes.

Squidward: Quality food?

SpongeBob: Uh-Huh!

Squidward: Good People?

SpongeBob: Yep!

Squidward: Discriminating tastes?

SpongeBob: Testify!

Squidward: Doh'! (breathes angrily, then runs up to customer then takes a Krabby Patty) Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage!

SpongeBob: Squidward! (The customer cries. SpongeBob comes and rocks customer like baby)

SpongeBob: The Krusty clientele needs to be cuddled and treated with respect. (takes Krabby Patty from Squidward and puts it in customers mouth like a baby bottle) There there. (to Squidward) Mr. Krabs will be ashamed! (Mr. Krabs walks in)

Mr. Krabs: All right you filthy bilge rats!

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?

Mr. Krabs: You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way! (goes around to the back of the Krusty Krab and starts tipping it and all the customers fall out and then puts it back and walks into the Krusty Krab)

SpongeBob: What's happening, Mr. Krabs?

Mr. Krabs: Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy frou-frou places! Where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!

Squidward: Fancy frou frou?

Mr. Krabs: We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof! (laughs)

SpongeBob: Chef exchange program?

Mr. Krabs: (stops laughing) Oh. Uh yeah, well you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes! (bus arrives) Heh, looks like it's early. (kicks SpongeBob on bus and it drives off)

Squidward: It was that easy? All these years? I've underestimated the power of public transportation! (other bus arrives with Le Schnook on it)

Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

Squidward: Does your middle name happen to be "No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here"? (Mr. Krabs and Squidward laugh)

Le Schnook: I find you disgusting! (they stop laughing) However, my culture dictates that I must kiss you regardless! (kisses Squidward two times then spits two times then does the same for Mr. Krabs)

Mr. Krabs: Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.

Squidward: But the surly attitude he has a step in the right direction! (cuts to scene of the bus dropping off SpongeBob at the Fancy! restaurant. SpongeBob then walks into the kitchen)

Fancy! Head Chef: What is this rubbish?! I would not wipe my own bottom with this! (slaps chef with a steak) Start over! And this (drinks boiled water then spits it on chef) I would not wash my own bottom with this after carefully wiping and wiping and wiping! (slaps chef) Now go stand in the corner and think about what you have done! And where is my exchange chef?!

SpongeBob: Um, right here, sir.

Fancy Head Chef: (laughs) There you are. Bon jour! (kisses SpongeBob two times, SpongeBob giggles and the chief slaps him) Now, get to your station and prepare me your best dish! (SpongeBob runs to a pot, puts some ingredients into it then takes out a Krabby Patty and blows a kiss and a heart shows up. The chef then grabs it and crushes it) This is not funny! And I certainly did not exchange my top sous chef for a, how you say, comedian! (puts Krabby Patty in SpongeBob's mouth and then pulls is nose causing him to eat it) Prepare me a gourmet dish, NOW! (SpongeBob runs over to a counter with vegetables on it)

SpongeBob: (starts chopping vegetables) I'm sure with all my years in the kitchen, I can make something other than... (chops vegetables into a Krabby Patty then laughs nervously) Just warming up. (Chief gets angry, he then screams than gets a tray of stuff and puts in in the oven) Come on, SpongeBob! (whistles and then takes out a Krabby Patty and throws it on the ground, Chief gets angry again, he then cracks an egg into a pan) Just one egg then... (egg turns into a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob gets mad and throws it on the ground along with many other Krabby Patties)

Fancy Head Chef: You are making a mockery of my... (Krabby Patty accidentally lands in his mouth and he eats it) This taste is fantastic! What do you call it? (he then eats another one)

SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty.

Fancy Head Chef: (is eating more Krabby Patties) The whole world must taste this! (time card then shows up saying "Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab". We then see that it is all decorated fancy)

Mr. Krabs: Hey Squidward, look at this! (holds up a plate with a small fruit on it) We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy (laughs and then Squidward smells it's horrible smell)

Squidward: Oh! What is that?!

Mr. Krabs: I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.

Le Schnook: Ho monsieur! It is the rare fruit of the kazook tree.

Mr. Krabs: So, it's supposed to smell like rotten gym socks?

Le Schnook: Its naturally rancid odor can only be neutralized by shredded gold.

Mr. Krabs: Shredded gold? (Le Schnook then starts shredding gold. Mr. Krabs screams and takes it away from him) Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?

Le Schnook: Price can be no object when it comes to dealing with exquisite food like this. It must be prepared with only the finest ingredients. And eaten with only the finest silverware! While sitting on the finest furniture! (Le Schnook tries to sit in one of the chair but it is just a billboard) This is not the chair I ordered...

Mr. Krabs: Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.

Le Schnook: And this fork of plastic, spray painted to look silver, is it not? I can not prepare food under these conditions! (cuts back to the Fancy! restaurant where there is a big line and everybody is eating a Krabby Patty)

Fancy Head Chief: Monsieur SpongeBob, although it is in direct violation of our chef exchange program rules, let me assure you that these kisses are not merely a formality. They are genuine! (kisses SpongeBob twice) I am sure that this is only the beginning of a long and... (SpongeBob's alarm on his wrist watch rings)

SpongeBob: Well, my time here is up. I am officially a Krusty Krab employee once again! (is about to walk out but the chief stops him)

Fancy Head Chef: I apologize, Monsieur SpongeBob, but you can see that my customers had grown rather fond of your Krabby Patties.

SpongeBob:(SpongeBob gasps) The Krabby Patties, I almost forgot! These babies also belong to the Krusty Krab! (starts taking all the Krabby Patties and putting them in a sack and then puts it in his suitcase) So long! (customers gasp and SpongeBob begins to leave and one customer holds on to his leg)

Customer: Wait, just one more?

SpongeBob: I'm sorry but I've got to go. (all customers hold on to his leg. However he manages to get out. Scene then switches to the Krusty Krab and it is out of business because it went bankrupt. We then see Mr. Krabs crying in his office.)

Mr. Krabs: I'm ruined! Busted! (phone then rings and Mr. Krabs answers it) Hello?

Pearl: (on phone) Daddy, the house is full of burglars. (Mr. Krabs laughs)

Mr. Krabs: No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men. (Mr. Krabs then hangs up and then notices Squidward being held onto by his arms by two men)

Squidward: Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!

Mr. Krabs: Uh, well you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.

Squidward: You sold me?!

Mr. Krabs: No! Bartered is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.

Man who's holding Squidward: Come on mac! (takes him away)

Squidward: You're pathetic! (Le Schnook then walks in)

Mr. Krabs: Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.

Le Schnook: Not quite. My time in the chef's exchange program has expired. So my eats and I are leaving. (hands Mr. Krabs a bill) This is for you.

Mr. Krabs: Is it money?

Le Schnook: It is the bill for my services. (Mr. Krabs unfolds the bill. His eyes become bloodshot, and he is unable to move.)

Man who was holding Squidward: One side, please (Repo men take Mr. Krab's desk and chair away while he is sitting in it, a repo man brings Mr. Krabs back into the restaurant lobby)

Mr. Krabs: (Crying) Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, I can still here his sweet little voice.

SpongeBob: (High pitched) Mr. Kra-a-abs?!

Mr. Krabs: Okay, now I'm scared.

SpongeBob: MR. KRABS!!

Mr. Krabs: Darn his cursed mocking voice! I... (notices SpongeBob) SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!

Customers(Simultaneously): (Oh, please, we must have some Krabby Patties. We just adore...) (Please, Krabby Patties...) (Krabby Patties (inaudible), please. Krabby Patties...)(Yay)

Mr. Krabs: (now talking to Squidward) Well Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientele back, and rich disgusting new clientele to boot! I'm back in business!

Squidward: Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?

Mr. Krabs: Oh no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, frou-frou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey get back you, eat your own. (Mr. Krabs throws them a bucket of Krabby Patties, the customers squeal like pigs.) Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs. (Blows another kiss and Squidward swallows it and starts choking and Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob laugh.)

Patchy: Let's go! (Patchy honks) Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is a real bringdown. Some music should soothe me jangled nerve. At least me in-dash-hi-fi-still works. (Patchy breaks his radio) Oh! Me ultra rare Frampton Comes Alive 8 Track destroyed! And I'm gonna miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if this traffic doesn't move soon! (Patchy cries) (Patchy's cell phone rings) Who's calling? Yes, Patchy, here, start talking.

Potty: Hey, Patchy, the New SpongeBob cartoon's about to start. Where are you, brawk?

Patchy: Stuck on the 101. Uh, be a dear and record it for me, will you?

Potty: Oh, I threw that old Betamax machine in the garbage, brawk!

Patchy: You what?!!

Potty: Oh, calm down, beardy.

Patchy: Potty, you know how important this cartoon is to me! (Someone honks at him) Do you mind?! I'm trying to talk to my parrot! Sorry, Potty. Just some landlubber. (dial tone rings) Potty? Hello, hello, hello, hello? (groans) Dropped again. (closes his phone) Curse this traffic...! Whew! (grunts) Ahh, home at last. What the? (His eyes break the sunglasses)Encino... it's gone. Noooooooooooooooo! (cries) You know, kids, this kind of reminds Patchy of a old story, another story about a lost city. why don't you check it out? No..... Encino.

[edit] SpongeBob's Segment Part 1; Going to Atlantis
(SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles.)

Patrick: A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: Hurry Patrick, hurry! (Patrick takes a photo of the bubble, but misses) How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?

Patrick: More like the scrap-heap. They never come out right! Oh well, let's try again.

SpongeBob: OK Patrick, this one's gonna be my masterpiece.

Patrick: I'm ready. (SpongeBob blows a bubble in his image.)

SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick!

Patrick: (Misses a photo of the bubble) Oh, I missed it again! Well, this darn camera isn't fast enough. (Throws camera to the ground and stamps it to submission.)

SpongeBob: Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo.

Patrick: It's not?

SpongeBob: No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble.

Patrick: It IS?

SpongeBob: Yes it is my friend, allow me to demonstrate.

Song: The Bubble Song

SpongeBob: The sun must set at the end of every day. And the curtain must fall at the end of every play. And every little bubble ever blown must someday, POP!

Patrick: Like presents, on Christmas day it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese souffle it doesn't last all day.

SpongeBob: I will try again. To blow a bubble that will last all day.

[SpongeBob begins to blow a giant bubble, it captures them both and floats away]

Patrick: Um, SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick, this bubble's gonna break all records!

Patrick: Well I hope it doesn't break until we get a bit closer to the ground.

SpongeBob: Huh? (looks down) What have I done!? (The two start screaming as the bubble drifts into a cave.)

SpongeBob: We'll never get out of here!

Patrick: NO!

(The bubble is popped by a jagged point on a half of a broken amulet)

Patrick: What happened?

SpongeBob: (pointing to broken amulet) That's what happened.

Patrick: Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.

SpongeBob: Antis. What do think that means, Patrick?

Patrick: Antis... antis... SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors. (Picks up the half of the amulet) SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birth right! (shoves into SpongeBob's face)

SpongeBob: My birth right!? (Falls) Ow ooh, Ow ooh ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!

Mr. Krabs: (Whistles) Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin', huh?.

Security Guard: Whatever you say.

Mr Krabs: (Mr Krabs pretends to be administration) Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.

Old Lady: But I thought it was free Tuesday.

Mr Krabs: No no no. Today's Monday, otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this 'I hate Mondays' shirt.

Old Lady: Good point.

Mr. Krabs: Enjoy the artifacts! (To self) Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one. (Hears SpongeBob and Patrick laughing) SpongeBob! (Hides, then re-emerges when SpongeBob and Patrick go into the museum) Phew, that was a close one. (Old lady points him out to a security guard then Mr. Krabs runs inside)

Squidward: Neptune's Ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge- (SpongeBob and Patrick run in excitedly, knocking Squidward over.) AAAH! Oh, would you two watch where you're- (Gasps) What is that? What are you doing with the Amulet of Atlantis?

SpongeBob: We were just-

Squidward: You're going to steal it!?

SpongeBob: No Squidward, we'd never-

Squidward: This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. (removes amulet half from SpongeBob.) Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso- (looks at the half-amulet on display and the half he took from SpongeBob) You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean Amulet!?

SpongeBob: What's an Atlantean omelet?

Squidward: AMULET, NOT OMELET!!!! It's the key to untold riches!

Mr Krabs:(shoves SpongeBob and Patrick and faces Squidward) Did somebody say untold riches!?

Squidward: Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lights are made with diamonds.

Mr Krabs: DIAMOND LIGHT BULBS!!!??? I wonder what they make the money out of?

Squidward: For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. (walks by mural with Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Patrick) All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!

SpongeBob: (points to bubble) Why is this bubble painted on the mural?

Squidward: That's just the oldest living bubble.

SpongeBob: The oldest living bubble alive? Behold Patrick-the oldest living bubble!

Patrick: This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen!

Squidward: That's just a painting you quarter-wit! Ha, quarter-wit, (looks at Mr. Krabs) it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some darn old bubble hails in comparison to the art...

Mr Krabs: Money...

Sandy:(suddenly arrives out of nowhere) And science, don't forget science. What's all the hubbub boys?

Squidward: These two chowder-brains found the missing half of the Amulet.

Sandy: THE AMULET OF ATLANTIS!!!!???? Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What ya all waitin' on? Let's hitch them two doggies up! (Squidward prepares to connect the two halves of the amulet) Go on Squidward!

Mr Krabs: Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger! [Squidward connects the two halves and a bright light activates]

Squidward: (Happy)

Sandy: (In Disbelief)

Patrick: Aaaah!

SpongeBob: Hoo hoo yeah, hoo hoo hoo!

[The Amulet shoots a beam at the ceiling and a bus drops from the resulting hole]

Squidward: The magical path to Atlantis is a van?!

Mr Krabs: Nice hot rod flames!

Patrick: [Amulet spins] What's it doing?

[Amulet lifts, flies, and attaches itself to the bus. The display reads Atlantis. The door opens.)

Sandy: Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya' look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!

Squidward: Fabulous decor!

Mr Krabs: Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?

Robot: Greetings. Welcome aboard the Sea Ship Atlantis. This is a non-stop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way.

Mr. Krabs: Bet there's some loose change in here!

SpongeBob: Ah, so this is what luxury feels like.

Squidward: Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub. (Mechanical arms come out of floor at command and gives Squidward a foot-rub)

Robot: Attention passengers, regretfully we lack the fuel needed for forward motion.

Everyone: What!?

(Cut to a gas station. Mr. Krabs tries to fuel the bus up, but finds no visible gas tank.)

Mr Krabs: (To Robot) Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?

Robot: We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call "song".

Mr. Krabs: Huh?

Robot: The engine of this vessel is fueled by song. The more you sing of your desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing.

Squidward: Does that make any sense?

SpongeBob: No, but I'm gained for singing any day!

Song: Fueling the Bus

SpongeBob: (in song) Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along! To a land where all our dre-e. (The bus lifts but drops when SpongeBob hits a wrong note) [normally] Whoops, sorry. (in song) To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true. A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee............

Mr Krabs: Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.

Plankton: Ha ha ha! Such a valiant desire! He he he! The lost weapons of Atlantis-the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done I plan to make them miiiiine!

Sandy: Did y'all hear something? I can hardly believe that there's a lost city where having smarts is more important-than being pretty! With all their advanced science, and my painfully large mind!

Sandy #2: [Clone] I bet we can figure out how to make wondrous things, like melons with edible rinds!

Squidward: As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis with their glorious aesthetics, I'll cop their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!

Patrick: I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh, (normal) I don't know what I like. (They start falling out of the sky)

Robot: Warning, you have run out of song fuel.

Everyone: AAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Squidward: Hey look, it's Atlantis.

SpongeBob: Pretty!

Everyone: AAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Bus crashes)

Squidward: You dimwits haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.

Mr. Krabs: (Everyone walks to a castle) Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell.

SpongeBob: Ring for the King, huh? (Rings the bell. A carpet rolls out from the doors ahead. Lord Royal Highness emerges.)

Lord Royal Highness: Welcome to Atlantis. I've been expecting you. (trips and falls down the really long stairway. Gets back up.) Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Lord Royal Highness, but my friends call me LRH.

SpongeBob: My friends call me SpongeBob. I'm here to see the oldest bubble.

LRH: Yes, of course.

Mr. Krabs: What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!

LRH: Oh, if it's gold you want, you'll find it in our vault.

Mr. Krabs: I'm Eugene. I like money.

LRH: Yes, I can see that. Pleasure to meet you. Come, I'll give you the grand tour of our Atlantean fortress. I'm so glad you're all here...

Plankton: They're gone. Now to get to those weapons... (tries to open glovebox door but fails.) Trapped! Ok, what do I have to work with here? (picks up flashlight, turns it on and sees a book in front of him.) What's this? Owner's manual!? Looks like I've found my escape route! (Laughs diabolically, crawls out via exhaust pipe and falls) Ow!

LRH: For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders. But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world.

Mr. Krabs: (sighs) Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!

LRH: But of course, follow me.

Mr. Krabs: Comin' through, boys! (Everybody frowns at Mr. Krabs when he passes in front of them rudley)

Plankton: These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost. (Squeezes under door) Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time! (Laughs diabolically)

[edit] Patchy's Segment Part 2; Encino gone in a flash
Patchy: Well, bad news, kids. Encino's still lost. Oh! But, at least I got me radio fixed! (Patchy snaps his fingers while listening to it, then, it explodes). Well, enjoy the rest of the show.

[edit] SpongeBob's Segment Part 2; At the Money Hall
LRH: It is both an honor and a pleasure to welcome you all to Atlantis. We haven't had visitors in quite some time. You see being a lost city has certain disadvantages, which I digress. Now if you'll just follow me, I'll show you our grandest achievements.

(Mr. Krabs grabs Squidward) Mr Krabs: Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold! Now, that street light better be a 600 carot diamond or else! (Starts unscrewing a light bulb while standing on Squidward) Hold still, Squidward!

Squidward: (straining) You're standing on my neck!

Mr. Krabs: (finds out light bulb is an ordinary one) What!? (falls)

LRH: Are you alright?

Mr. Krabs: Yes, I feel odd. (acts wierdly)

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you ok?

Mr. Krabs: I know that smell anywhere. Me pockets! They be smelling loot! (He smells money, and his pockets bark and direct him to the Treasure Room, the pockets eat the money)

LRH: Those pockets of yours really have a thing for treasure.

Mr. Krabs: These are me hounds to me pants.

LRH: What you see here is a glimpse of ancient Atlantean history. Long ago we abandoned our obsession with wealth to focus on the pursuit of knowledge. So help yourself to as much as your pockets can carry.

Mr. Krabs: As much as me pockets can carry?

Song: Mr. Krabs' Song

Mr. Krabs (Singing): Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche! (yodels) Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money! I hope me heart can take it!

Doctor (Not Singing): Clear! (Shocks Krabs)

Mr. Krabs (Singing): I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press. Oh, make me into money, Mr. wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green! Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did! With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!

SONG OVER

LRH: Mr. Krabs! We're off to see the bubble! Would you care to join us?

Mr. Krabs: Are you kiddin'? I just got here! (Dives into the money)

LRH: Very well, then. Off we go.

Patrick: (Under breath) SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?

SpongeBob: Patrick! Shh!

LRH: Don't dally, lads. We don't want to be left behind, do we?

SpongeBob: (Salute) No, sir! Come on along, Patrick!

Sandy: You know, LRH, I was born with a healthy scientific curiosity and I was wondering if I could get a peek at some of your scientific achievements?

LRH: Of course, Miss Cheeks. Here we are, the combination of all of our technology. I give you the Atlantean Hall, of Science. (Opens the door, a lot of futuristic gadgets are seen)

Sandy: Hoppin' acorns! Look at all this hi-tech gear! (Looks at one invention) What does this gizmo do?

LRH: It's a bio-mass converting device. It can take any house-hold object, (puts a comb on the platform, it goes in) this comb for example, and turn it into say, ice cream! (Presses a button and ice cream pops out) Would anyone like to try it?

SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh! Oh! Me! Me!

LRH: Go ahead! (Hands them spoons, they eat)

SpongeBob: Mmm! Comb flavored!

Sandy: What else can it turn things into?

LRH: Actually it can only turn things into ice cream. We haven't worked that bug out, yet. But I can show you the most amazing/fantasic device created by Atlantean hands. (Shows them a big machine) Behold. This grand machine allows the user to be broken down into nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand-to-hand.

Sandy: How's it work?

LRH: Please take a seat and I'll explain. (They do so, and metal gears go on their heads) Now, here's how it works--

SpongeBob: Hey cool! (He pushes the center button and disappears into thin air)

Patrick: Where'd SpongeBob go?

LRH: Right now his molecules are being broken down into data. Which is assembled into this computer, and stored on these tapes. Then reassembled on a much smaller scale--

SpongeBob: Someone help me!

LRH: And finally passes through this tube and into this tank which contains every element known to-- (looks closer) Oh, dear heavens! It looks like our scientists were working on a very agressive case of the sniffles. He could be in trouble!

Patrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob! I'm coming to help you! (Pushes the center button and disappears like SpongeBob)

Squidward: Okay, I've seen enough. Let me outta this thing! (Pushes the center button rapidly hoping it will get the gear off his head, but he disappears and goes into an 8-bit game) What's going on here? I-- oh no! Ah!(He sees a runny nose)

SpongeBob: Squidward, don't make any sudden movements! (The nose sneezes out four germs and Squidward falls over, jumps rapidly, and runs)

Squidward: Help, aah! (SpongeBob and Patrick follow, the germs chase them, and Sandy beams in)

SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: HELP, SANDY!!!

Sandy: Sounds like them critters is in trouble! (The nose puts SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward in it, and the germs guard Sandy from getting to them)

Sandy: Hold on, fellas! I'll be there soon, as soon as I send these critters to their doom! (A title screen shows like a Nintendo game)

Song: Sandy's Song

Sandy (Singing): Look out, germs. The end is here, Your days are numbered, 'cause Sandy's here! I'll get these germs, and make 'em pay, with some good old fashioned karate. (Hi-yah!) If I borrow some elements from the periodic table I can mix up a brew that is sure to disable any virus, bug, or sniffle that steps into my path. And make them feel my mi-cro-sco-pic wrath!!!!! Hi-yah! (Hits the nose with a submarine and defeats it, the gang flies out, they all cheer)

         GAME
         OVER
LRH: Well, shall we continue on with the rest of the tour?

Sandy: Y'all head out without me. (Hits the center button, going in again)

LRH: Well then, good luck. Have fun. We'll see you at dinner. (to SpongeBob) Your friend Sandy certainly is an exciteable one.

SpongeBob: Quite.

Squidward: Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoos the longest.

(In the heater vent behind Squidward is Plankton, who chuckles as he found the weapons)

Song: Plankton's Song

Plankton (Singing): Oh, what a beautiful sight! Weapons as far as the eye can see. But which one will be right for me? How do I pick? Which one will do the trick? Which is best to guarantee eternal rest? So many weapons! How do I choose? Look at this one with a beatiful fuse! And with this one I couldn't lose. That one will surely give them the blues..... And this one here matches my shoes! Come on, Plankton, just pick one and forget about your shoes! Eeny, meeny, miney moe, I pick you, now let's go! (Chooses a huge tank, cut to LRH giving the tour)

Squidward: This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?

LRH: Gentlemen? What is art?

SpongeBob: Oh, oh! I know, I know! (Squidward shoves SpongeBob so he can fit in frame)

Squidward: I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that effects a sense of beauty.

LRH: Not even close! (Squidward looks shocked) Art is what happens when you learn to dream. (Hands SpongeBob a blue paint brush) Go ahead. Dream a little. (He hits the wall and it magically turns into SpongeBob's door)

SpongeBob: It looks like my front door!

LRH: Behold! The Hall of Arts! (He opens the door, Squidward's mouth opens, they step in)

Squidward: Incredible! (He cries) The creativity! The artistry! (He walks by a painting) This painting is so realistic, it looks like you could step straight into it.

LRH: And you can! (He grabs Squidward and throws him in the painting)

SpongeBob: Whoa!

Squidward: This place is amazing! (Steps into other paintings)

Song: Squidward's Song

Squidward (Singing): Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet! From the very first drawings on walls in caves, art has been what the heart and soul craves! So pick up a brush, a pencil or pen. If you don't like this one, paint it again! From now on please call me Sir Real. (surreal) I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type. But I've finally found something that lives up to the hype. I can say honestly and with great certainty, that Atlantis is where I want to spend, eternity (holds note, song over)

Atlantean: Hey can you not sing? I'm trying to model here.

Atlantean Painter: Now hold on, Nando. Why don't you take five. I'm really digging this squid's form. (The other Atlantean sighs and walks away)

Squidward: Look's like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead.

SpongeBob: Okay. Bye, Squidward! (They leave, and Squidward poses)

LRH: Now this section of town is known for it's advances in the science of fondue cooking.

SponeBob: Excuse me, sir. This tour's been great and all but uh, can we see the bubble now?

LRH: Do excuse me. Most folks don't stay with the tour this long. Of course you can. First, remember this. This bubble is over one million years old. It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place. Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet. It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic. But most importanly, remember to... HAVE FUN!!! (Points to where it is, and they go in)

SpongeBob: There it is, Patrick!

SpongeBob and Patrick: The World's Oldest Living Bubble! Whoo! (They land on the safe keeping tube)

SpongeBob: Look at it, Patrick. So ancient. So floaty. It is the most beautiful wrinkled up, dusty old bubble I've ever seen!

Patrick: Like a delicate air raisin! (They slide off)

LRH: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to make ready for tonight's dinner. So I'm just going leave you two friendly strangers alone with our most beloved ancient and fragile Atlantean relic. Join us in the dining hall when you've had an eye-full.

SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Lord Royal Highness sir. (They stare shove their face in the glass) Just look at it, Patrick. Ah, the stories this bubble could tell. I just wish we could get a closer look (he leans in but the glass moves) Patrick! Get the--

Patrick: Oh golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this! (They manage get it back up, after a close call when it lands against the glass on SpongeBob's side and bounces off with no damage, and laugh in victory)

SpongeBob: Whoo, that was a close one, buddy!

Patrick: Yeah. We almost popped the most prized possesion of all Atlantiseans! (Laughs)

SpongeBob: Boy, that would have been our greatest blunder without a doubt! But we should go before something bad does happen.

Patrick: Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before leave.

SpongeBob: Great idea, Patrick!

Both: Cheese! (Patrick's flash pops the bubble)

SpongeBob: (With teeth closed) Patrick, did you hear something?

Patrick: (With teeth closed) I sort of a popping sound?

SpongeBob: Uh-huh. (They look at each other screaming at the empty space and their skin peels off, and SpongeBob's eyes land in his mouth, cut to the gang at dinner)

LRH: So sorry I'm late. The tour ran a little long. So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?

Squidward: I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college. (Shows LRH a painting)

LRH: Absolutley marvelous! And Eugene, I assume the hall of treasure was everything you hoped for? (Mr. Krabs is brain-washed by the money) And Sandra, how did you find our laboratories?

Sandy: They are just amazing! I used your invention room to make this!

LRH: Splendid. What does it do?

Sandy: I'll show you. (Pushes a button and the food goes directly in her) Now I can eat underwater without removing my helmet! This is just the beginning! I should have a cure for the common cold up and running by tomorrow afternoon with your hi-tech lab! (SpongeBob and Patrick run in nervous)

LRH: SpongeBob, Patrick, tell me. How did you enjoy our rarest and most prized posession?

SpongeBob: (Gulps) We have to go back to Bikini Bottom now!

All: Huh?

LRH: Ahahaha! Come. Enjoy the best Atlantean cuisine has to offer before you leave.

(SpongeBob and Patrick shake)

Squidward: What is wrong with you two morons?

SpongeBob: We have to go home now!

Squidward: Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?

SpongeBob: Because, uh, Gary misses me? (Cuts to SpongeBob's house, Gary is having a party with other snails)

Patrick: WE DESTROYED YOUR MOST PRIZED POSESSION! (Shuts mouth)

LRH: (Pauses) Ahahaha! If there's one thing we Atlanteans enjoy, it's a healthy dose of dark humor!

SpongeBob: It's not a joke, we burst the bubble! (Sandy and Squidward gasp)

LRH: Haha. That's not the real bubble. It's just a prop for the tourists. (Holds up the bubble in a bottle) This is the real deal.

SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh! (Patrick takes a flash and it pops)

LRH: (Snarl) Summon the Atlantean Royal Guard! (They come and grunt. SpongeBob and Patrick shake in fear of what they have done.) Sieze these hostile bubble poppers!

Sandy: Don't just stand there! Move! (She pushes them, they attack with a trident, pickaxe, and flail.)

Mr. Krabs: Can't you go any faster, Sandy?

Sandy: Maybe, if y'all would move your feet!

Mr. Krabs: Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!

Sandy: [Groans] (the guards shoot balls at them and Sandy grabs Patrick and flings him at them like a Ninja would) Come on, Patrick! (They shoot and Sandy uses SpongeBob as a shield)

SpongeBob: (Laughs) That tickles!

Sandy: Hang in there, little buddy. (Grabs Squidward and puts their shooting balls on his tentacles and shoots them at the guards, then uses Krabs)

LRH: Don't let them get away! (The guards follow the gang outside but they all confront Plankton's tank and Plankton aims at them while laughing evily)

[edit] Patchy's Segment Part 3
[edit]Part 1; Patchy Melts
Patchy: This is the end of Patchy. No water, no food, and still no Encino.

Patchy: Here come the vultures the pick me bones! (Potty flies up)

Patchy: Shiver me timbers! It's Potty! I wonder what parrot tastes like...

Patchy: Come back here!

Patchy: Uh-oh. Here come the hallucinations.

SpongeBob: (SpongeBob laughs) Patchy, it's me. SpongeBob SquarePants. (Patchy is excited, and then he cries)

SpongeBob: Don't lose hope. Everything will be all right when you get into Encino.

Patchy: B-B-But Encino is gone.

SpongeBob: It's not gone, if you believe.

Patchy: Believe, believe. (Falls asleep)

[edit]Part 2; Encino is Back
Patchy: (gasps) Welcome to Encino! It's back!

Patchy: (Hugs it) SpongeBob was right! All I had to do was believe. (laughs)

(Song)

You gotta believe. It was out of sight. You gotta believe. I'm back in Encino. You gotta believe. Everything's all right. The sky above, and ground below. Great to be back in Encino. It was lost, some time ago, just glad to be back home. You gotta believe. I'm back in Encino. You gotta believe. Everything's all right. You gotta believe. I'm back in Encino. You gotta believe. Everything's all right. Ohh! Ohh! You got to believe. I'm back in Encino. You gotta believe. It was out of sight. You gotta believe. I'm back in Encino. You got... (record scratches)

[edit]Part 3; Encino is gone
Patchy: (Potty brawks, and then, pokes Patchy) Ow! Ow!

Patchy: It was all a hallucination. Encino's still gone!

(Patchy cries)

Patchy: Ooh, a sandwich! Potty, you're a lifesaver.

Patchy: Oh...! Potty, you know I don't like mayo!

Patchy: (To a vulture) Here you want some? Go on. Take it.

Patchy: I don't like the mayonnaise, you know.

Patchy: Once it gets above 130, 135, the mayonnaise gets kind of grody, you know.

[edit] SpongeBob's Segment Part 3; The End of Atlantis
Plankton: (Laughs evily) Cower to me, fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath! (He stomps on the switch but is too small to make it work) Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, "PREPARE TO TASTE MY WRATH!!!!!!" (He stomps on it rapidly, harder) Oh, you! (Grabs rock, struggles) Prepare to taste my wrath! (Throws the rock on the switch and it works)

Computer: LAUNCH SEQUENCE DEPLOYED! (The tank shakes and Plankton laughs evily, everyone gasps and they hold each other, it blows out ice cream, a cow moos, SpongeBob and Patrick eat the ice cream)

Patrick: Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream.

SpongeBob and Patrick: Thanks, Plankton.

Plankton: Ice cream? It shoots ICE CREAM!!!??? (He gets out) Over-sized ice cream maker! (Kicks it) Yah! Ouch! Ow!

LRH: Look! A talking speck! This talking speck will make a fantastic (looks at SpongeBob and Patrick) replacement for our recently deflated national treasure! (Looks at Plankton and baby talk) Won't you, little fella?

Plankton: I'LL DESTROY ALL OF YOU-- (LRH squeezes him)

LRH: Amazing! This is so much better than that dusty old bubble! (Plankton is in the cage)

Plankton: You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of-- (someone take's a picture) Hey! Can't you read! (Points at sign) No flash photography! (The gang is getting on the van)

LRH: So nice to meet you all. I hope you have a safe journey back home. And do come back any time.

SpongeBob: So long. And thanks for the tour. (Everyone is in, and LRH closes the door, takes the amulet off the van and gives it to a guard)

LRH: Dispose of this quickly. We can't survive anymore visitors like these.

Guard: (Salutes) Sir, yes sir. (He runs to the dump and throws it in there, LRH waves good-bye as they go off)

LRH: I thought sponges were supposed to make life easier. (Cut to bus)

Song: Goodbye, Atlantis

SpongeBob: Goodbye, Atlantis. But we really have to go. Back to a little town, that is the greatest place I know-oh-oh-oh-oh! Back to Bikini Bottom! I can hardly wait!

Mr. Krabs: But what about the treasure? It was really great!

SpongeBob: I love Bikini Bottom! It's where my Gary is!

Sandy: But Atlantis had that science stuff at which I was a whiz!

SpongeBob: Soon I'll see the Krusty Krab. Where I'm happily employed!

Patrick: But Atlantis had the oldest bubble which I cruelly destroyed!

SpongeBob: You can't beat Bikini Bottom! No place is so nice!

Squidward: But Atlantis was a fabulous, artistic paradise!

SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, but it's the end of our Atlantean vacation!

Squidward: And back to my depressing life of quiet desperation.

SpongeBob: Good-bye, Atlantis. We're Bikini Bottom bound!

Squidward: Please turn this bus around!

SpongeBob: We had our fun!

Patrick: We sure did!

SpongeBob: But now we're done.

Sandy: And I'm bummed.

SpongeBob: We're on our way!

Sandy: Can't we stay?

SpongeBob: So now we say good-bye!

Mr. Krabs: I think I'm gonna cry!

Patrick: Me too!

SpongeBob: Good-bye, Atlantis. We're Bikini Bottom bound. There's no place like home!

Mr. Krabs: There's no place like Atlantis!

SpongeBob: I can't wait to get home.

Mr. Krabs: I don't wanna go back!

SpongeBob: We're Bikini Bottom bound!

Sandy: Please don't make us leave!

SpongeBob: We're Bikini Bottom bound!

Squidward: Stop saying that!

SpongeBob: I even love the sound!

All: Good-bye Atlantis!

SpongeBob: Bikini Bottom is the greatest place to be! I can--

All: Good-bye Atlantis!

[edit] Patchy's Segment Part 4; Patchy returns
Patchy: Pretty good story, eh, kids?

Patchy: I found Encino.

Patchy: But, it's all tiny. Somebody must've...

Patchy: Ahhhhhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhhhh!

Norblott Five's mother: Sorry, sir. Our son Norblott Five was messing around with his Shrink-a-tron again.

(The Tornado picks up Patchy and encino)

Patchy: No, no, no, no! I want Encino full size again!

Patchy: There's no place like home. There's no place like home.

Norblott Five's mother: Ok, hand it over, Norblott Five.

Norblott Five's mother: We'll fix your town, beardy.

Patchy: Beardy?

Patchy: Arrr! Arrr! Arrrr! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Ahhhhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhhhh!

Patchy: Well, everything's back to the right size, eh, potty?

Patchy: Potty?

Potty: Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrg!

Patchy: Um, I'm a little busy right now, but, you, can stop by for your old pal Patchy.

Patchy: And some more SpongeBob SquarePants. Bye. Potty, let go of me.

(SpongeBob laughs)

(Gary is snoring until the alarmhorn blows. SpongeBob’s blanket flies off but reveals a box for SpongeBob's body, a fork for the nose, and 2 potatoes for the feet)
SpongeBob: (laughs) Nice try, "alarmy", but you got to get up pretty early to wake me up on "picture day"!.
Gary: Meow. (crawls under SpongeBob's blanket)
SpongeBob: Now, if you'll excuse me, Gary, I must go make myself picturesque. (cut to SpongeBob putting a vacuum on his face then using a rolling pin to make his face shine. Then he gets some red and blue paint to paint the stripes on his socks. Next, he rolls on some paint for his pants and uses a white crayon for his teeth. He puts on a wig and then he turns it into The Beatles’ hair style, then a Jamaican hairdo, then shaves it off.) Perfect! I'm ready. Whoo-hoo!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: (humming until a piece of seaweed leaves a green residue on his clothes) Fine, not to worry, no problem.(and did it again) Vacuum, Rolling Pin, Crayon, Red and Blue Paint.
SpongeBob: Perfect I'm ready!!! Aaaaa...gain!

Gary: Meeow?

SpongeBob: I must do a correct approach...(Walks out with an umbrella and sees Squidward picking up a newspaper) Hi Squidward...I'd love to chat right now but it's picture day...(A garbage truck picks up SpongeBob and dips him in a trash mess inside it thinking he is a trash can and sets him down in a ugly, filthy, scummy mess. Squidward laughs at SpongeBob and mocks him as SpongeBob vomits out a garbage bag. SpongeBob does the vacuum, rolling pin, etcetera before walking outside and holding a trash can in front of him so that the garbage truck won't dip him in the garbage. This succeeds and SpongeBob runs off.)

SpongeBob: Still looking good Spongy, and Boating School is just around the corner. (crowd is screaming and running away)

Harold: Take cover! The teenagers, they've been let out of school and they're pelting us with balloons filled with... (gets hit with a balloon that leaves a red pile of goo on his back. SpongeBob tastes it)
SpongeBob: Ketchup?
Fish: Save yourself, kid. I'm already finished. (SpongeBob runs away while dodging all the balloons. He hides behind a dumpster, but there is a kid waiting for him with a ketchup bottle)
Teenager: Gotcha!
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, don't squirt! Please, you've got to spare me. I've got picture day today.
Teenager: Oh, pictures, huh? Well, let me help you with your makeup. (squirts ketchup at SpongeBob but SpongeBob blocks ketchup with his tongue and jumps away.) More teenagers run towards SpongeBob but he notices a hot dog stand and hides on the top where the giant hot dog is posing as mustard)
SpongeBob: Well, I'm not sure how I did it, but I... (gets squirt with ketchup by an old man who missed his hot dog)
Old Man: Fiddlesticks. Missed again. (cut to SpongeBob changing again)
SpongeBob: And now, as an extra precaution to keep me looking shiny and new...(takes out small bottle labled "Sponge Gloss") No grime can penetrate the glossy sheen(puts on some Sponge Gloss) of Sponge Gloss.(sparkles) (dodges everyone by hiding in all places. Then he spots the Boating School) There it is. So close, and still so shiny. (the sun comes out and its beams reflect off the gloss and into a truck driver's eyes that causes him to crash and spill water on SpongeBob, making the gloss come off) Hey, it's just a splash of water. (a truck filled with stamps crashes and spills stamps all over SpongeBob) Stamps? All over me! (he tries taking them off but a truck spills oatmeal all over SpongeBob) Oatmeal? (a truck filled with glue spills all over SpongeBob) Glue. (cut to SpongeBob taking a shower and brushing all the stuff off of him)
Patrick: Hey, buddy.
SpongeBob: Patrick, a little privacy here.
Patrick: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly.
SpongeBob: Well, go ahead, but I don't have time to play right now. I am late for picture day, and I just can't seem to get to school without being covered by unsightly debris. If only I had a sealed barrier to protect me from the filth of the outside world.
Patrick: I have a solution. (licks up all the jelly)
SpongeBob: Ew!.
Patrick: Ah. I have solved my hunger problem.
SpongeBob: That's it! (jumps in the jar) This jelly jar will insulate me from the dirty dregs of Bikini Bottom. If you don't mind, Patrick, we don't have much time. (Patrick runs to the Boating School with SpongeBob still in the jar)
Patrick: We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick...
Patrick: Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, Patrick! I'm not jelly, I'm not jelly! (is poured into the taco)
Patrick: HUH?! SpongeBob, get out of my taco! (SpongeBob sobs) What's the matter, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: (crying): Patrick?
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: (crying): I just wanted to take a decent picture today. Because someday, I will graduate from Boating School. And I don't want to be remembered as the guy covered in peanut butter and taco shells!
Mrs. Puff: There you are. (takes SpongeBob inside. Meanwhile, the photographer is taking another lady's picture)
Photographer: Say cheese. (takes the picture)
Mrs. Puff: And here's the last one. Now, just give a nice smile to the camera, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Wait, can I go home and change first?
Photographer: No time. Say cheese.
SpongeBob: (sobbing): Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese!
Photographer: Quit that moody brooding. This will clean you up. (squirts all the stuff off of SpongeBob with water) Don't snivel like that. A winner doesn't snivel. Try putting this on. (SpongeBob puts on a green outfit) This is it. Now you are looking like a winner. (SpongeBob cries when he looks at his outfit)
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, please stop crying so he can take the picture.
Photographer: Do not worry, Mrs. Puff. I brought Pearlie.
SpongeBob: I can't stop crying!
Photographer: (opens up his briefcase that has a giant pair of dentures in it) This will make you smile, yeah, whether you want to or not. (puts the giant teeth in SpongeBob's mouth) Now say cheese.
SpongeBob: (muffled): Cheese. (cut to later) There I am. (looking at his cautious memories book) Hey, I don't look so bad after all! (everyone in the book is smiling like SpongeBob)
(at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs checks the register but it's empty)
Mr. Krabs: Yeesh, we need some customers in here. (Patrick comes in Krusty Krab groaning) What's gotten into you?!
Patrick: I don't know. (his stomach turns into different shapes and sizes) What's happening to me?
SpongeBob: I think I can explain. (lifts up Patrick's belly) Yes, I've seen this one before. It's a common symptom. Patrick is suffering from Krabby Patty withdrawal. He needs one, or he'll keep mumbling about it for the next 3-1/2 minutes.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, he needs one, eh? (to register) Methinks a paying customer's in our midst. Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?
Patrick: (gasps) Give me.
Mr. Krabs: Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?
Patrick: Oh, yeah, I can pay for it.
Mr. Krabs: Good boy. (cut to Patrick inhaling a bunch of Krabby Patties like a vacuum)
Narrator: Ten seconds later. (Patrick is snoring)
Mr. Krabs: My good man, how you doing? (Patrick mumbles) Excellent. Now, let's get down to business. (gets out his receipt)
Patrick: What's that?
Mr. Krabs: It's your bill.
Patrick: I don't have any money.
Mr. Krabs: What?! I thought you said you could pay for it!!!
Patrick: Oh, I'm paying for it, all right. (belches)
Mr. Krabs: Non-paying customer! (alarm blares while the whole place is put on lock down)
Patrick: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: You're gonna pay, one way or another. (cut to Mr. Krabs and Patrick in bathroom) All right, Patrick. If you're not gonna pay for your food with money, you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine. (looks at the trash on the floor) I'll be back in a while to check up on you. (mumbles) Bottom-feeding imbeciles.
Patrick: No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la. (pushes the bucket along the floor leaving puddles of water on the ground) Work, work, work, work.
Mr. Krabs: So, Patrick, how are you...? (gasps) What in blazes did you do?
Patrick: (sitting on the ground with green soap on his belly) I accidentally tried the hand soap. (eats some more and burps) It doesn't taste as good as it smells. (Mr. Krabs mutters while pushing Patrick into the kitchen. Opens up a freezer door)
Mr. Krabs: See these ice cube trays? I want you to put 'em in that bucket.
Patrick: How do I do it?
Mr. Krabs: Figure it out.
Patrick: Uh... I have to be very gentle. (does the exact opposite of what he says [closes the doors, picks up the freezer and throws it on the bucket, causing it to break into pieces])
Mr. Krabs: What the...? What are you doing?
Patrick: Almost done, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: You've destroyed me refrigerator. You've destroyed many of the thing I love. I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up. (cut to in front of the trash chute) Alls you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so. (throws a trash bag down the chute) See?
Patrick: Yup.
Mr. Krabs: Good, because if you mess this up you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again. (Patrick screams)
Patrick: Hurry, hurry, hurry! (throws some sacks into the trash chute fast)
Mr. Krabs: (to SpongeBob) Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe.
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, Mr. Krabs. (goes by the trash room but hears some crashing so he checks it out) Patrick, what's up, buddy?
Patrick: (a bunch of trash bags are stuck) I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down.
SpongeBob: (laughs) That's because you didn't hit the trash compactor switch. (turns the compactor on. All the trash is gone)
Patrick: SpongeBob, you're a genius! (sees the bag SpongeBob is holding) Oh, no, there's one left!
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's not a trash bag.
Patrick: (throws the money bag in the compactor but it won't work) Why won't you go down?
Mr. Krabs: Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick? (Krusty Krab explodes. The trash compactor comes down in its original spot and spits out the money that was in the bag on Mr. Krabs)
Patrick: Can I eat now? (Mr. Krabs frowns) 

(an envelope is pushed through SpongeBob’s door)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Postman. Thanks, Gary. (throws some popcorn into Gary's mouth) Hm, can't read the return address. (tears the envelope open) Maybe this will shed some light. (reads the paper) Hey, SpongeBob, it's your cousin Blackjack. Guess what? I'm out of prison and decided to pay your parents a visit. If you want to see them again, meet me for a wrestling match at their house. Try it little man. Blackjack. (end of letter) Cousin Blackjack's out of prison?!
Gary: Mao?
SpongeBob: That's right, Gary! The cousin Blackjack! The same cousin Blackjack that used to beat me up all the time when we were kids. (flashback to SpongeBob with a bow tie and blue hat on)
Blackjack: (laughing) Come on, little man. Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough.
SpongeBob: Why should we?
Blackjack: Because it'll show what a little man you are. (spins SpongeBob around and plays with him as a jump rope. End of flashback)
SpongeBob: Oh, no. That was years ago, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: My sentiments exactly. Just imagine what he must look like now. (imagines Blackjack as a giant) Hi, SpongeBob. It's been a while. Good to see that you're still a little man. (laughs. Picks up SpongeBob and tears him in half then laughs some more) That brute has my parents. I gotta get over there. (puts his clothes in a suitcase) Gary, I don't know how long I'll be gone. I don't know if I'll ever come back.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I may get beaten to a quivering pulp but I must do it, for the sake of my parents. (wipes his eyes with a pair of underwear. Cut to SpongeBob’s parents house where the building has been wrapped around with police tape and plastic) Oh, my gosh, what happened to my parents' house? What's this? "Do not cross?" Is that police tape? There's only one reason for the police being here: a crime has been committed. No! Get it together, SquarePants. To face Blackjack, you've got to be as tough as nails. (forces himself inside the house) Huh? What?! All the furniture is covered in plastic. The police must have covered everything to preserve the crime scene. What could have happened here?(walks forward a little) What's this? Blackjack smashed my family portrait. Oh, no. What has he done with my parents? (imagines parents watching TV)
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you what with you in the office all hours of the day. (Mr. SquarePants snorts. Blackjack busts down the door and laughs) I got a new outfit for ya. (both parents are whimpering)
SpongeBob: That fiend. Where did he take them? I must find more evidence. What's this? Another note. (reads note) SpongeBob, I paid your parents a visit. Now, I'm gonna do the same with Gramma! You better hurry, little man-boy. Blackjack. (end of note) He's gonna get Grandma, too! I have to stop him. (cut to Grandma's house) Grandma! Where are you? Are you ok? Grandma? You in here? Grandma? (sees a gingerbread man on a plate) Oh, no, I'm too late! He burnt you to a crisp. Oh, that animal! (sobs)
Grandma: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Grandma? Are you talking to me from beyond the beyond?
Grandma: Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes. You're just in time. I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men.
SpongeBob: But where's Blackjack?
Grandma: Oh, Blackjack just called and left a message for you. He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up.
SpongeBob: Loose ends. My parents! He's tied them up?
Grandma: And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun. (SpongeBob imagines his parents being hung over a boiler by Blackjack) And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess.
SpongeBob: Cleaning up the mess? (face deflates) I got to get help. I'll go to Uncle Cap'N Blue's. He'll know what to do. (runs to Cap’N Blue's where he is mowing the yard. SpongeBob jumps on the lawn mower) Uncle Cap'N Blue, I need your help.
Uncle: Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob. Plant a firm one on me, Bobby. (shakes SpongeBob's hand but tears his arm off in the process)
SpongeBob: I need you to help me rescue my parents.
Uncle: Sure, Little Bobby. I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right. (hands back his arm. SpongeBob mows the lawn)
Narrator: 346 minutes later.
SpongeBob: Uncle Cap’N Blue, I need to help my parents. They're in danger.
Uncle: (turns off the mixer) What? You want to build a fence? (laughs) The boy came to work.
SpongeBob: Actually, I came to try to find my...
Uncle: (shoves wooden boards, hammers, and nails in SpongeBob’s face) And when you're done, I've made a tomato and clam juice smoothie to refresh you. (drinks the smoothie out of the mixer) Ah. (SpongeBob builds a fence all the way around Uncle Cap’N Blue's property) (over speaker) And how many candles you burning out there? Over. (indistinct speech and static) Do you copy? Over? (tries turning the knob) Copy? Do you copy?
SpongeBob: Uncle Cap’N Blue, Uncle Cap’N Blue? Please help me.
Uncle: Well, of course you can. (SpongeBob cuts off some coral trees, paints the house, and fixes the boat. When he's done, it's nighttime)
Narrator: Much, much, much later.
SpongeBob: (SpongeBob uses his tongue to crawl to Uncle Cap'n Blue's house. Yells) I AM DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR MY MOMMY AND DADDY!!!*** 
Uncle: Landscaping? Isn't it a little dark out for landscaping? (SpongeBob grabs the music player and yanks it out of the wall)
SpongeBob: Listen, Uncle Cap’N Blue. We don't have much time. Cousin Blackjack has my parents help captive at his house.
Uncle: They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison? Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid.
SpongeBob: That's why we have to rescue them now!
Uncle: Whoa there, Little Bobby. No can do.
SpongeBob: But Uncle Cap’N Blue, I need the help of a crime fighter like you.
Uncle: No, no, I don't chase criminals these days. I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home. You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy. An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind. Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?
SpongeBob: You mean they won't give me a push on the swing set?
Uncle: Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body. But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to Blackjack's right now. (SpongeBob digs up the concrete with his fingers) Just try to relax until we get there. (drives 20 feet and stops) There it is. We're here. (SpongeBob gets out) Uh, lock the door behind you, kid. (SpongeBob pushes down the lock and Uncle Cap’N Blue drives back into his house. SpongeBob goes up the steps and steps on a one that makes noise. A guard worm growls and barks at SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Nice wormy, nice wormy. Nice wormy. (grabs the door handle to knock but is tapped on the shoulder by his Uncle in a thought cloud)
Uncle: Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you? (SpongeBob imagines himself knocking on the door and Blackjack grabbing him through the door and using him as dental floss. He screams)
SpongeBob: Uncle Cap'n Blue is right. I'm not cut out for this. I should just turn around and go home. (Mrs. SquarePants screams) Mother! (runs through the door) Mom?
Mrs. SquarePants: Help me!
SpongeBob: They're trapped in the basement. (runs down into the basement) Mom, dad, quick! Let's get out of here.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party.
SpongeBob: Party?
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, why yes. We're celebrating your Cousin Blackjack's release from prison.
Mr. SquarePants: Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame...
Mrs. SquarePants: I told you, Harold, that was the fumigator's fault.
SpongeBob: The fumigator's? So that wasn't a crime scene I saw at your house.
Mr. SquarePants: The only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill. But they should be gone by now.
SpongeBob: So you two aren't being tortured by Cousin Blackjack?
Mr. SquarePants: No, SpongeBob. Your Cousin Blackjack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways. Never again will he litter.
Blackjack: That's right, little man.
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, well here comes the man of the hour now. He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again. He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days. (SpongeBob’s eyes break)
Blackjack: Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?
SpongeBob: (whimpering) To quiver. (hides his eyes, nose, and mouth inside his head)
Blackjack: I always knew you were a little man. Prepare to live your past in the present. (laughs)
SpongeBob: (whimpering) Come on, Little Bobby. Don't let him beat you. You've got to stand up for yourself this time. That's it! I am not gonna take this anymore! I am putting my foot down! You wanna tussle? Well, let's tussle it up! (Cousin Blackjack runs at SpongeBob and hangs onto his leg. He is the size of SpongeBob’s foot) Cousin Blackjack?
Blackjack: In the living flesh. (grunts as he takes off SpongeBob’s shoe and punches his big toe)
SpongeBob: That tickles.
Blackjack: Just like the old days, eh, cousin?
SpongeBob: Yeah, Blackjack, you haven't changed a bit. (everyone laughs)

(SpongeBob is riding on his horse, and muscular, and is saving a woman tied on the railroad tracks screaming)
Woman: Help!
SpongeBob: Hey, yah!
Woman: Help, help.
SpongeBob: Whoa, stop. (horse stops) There, there. You're safe now little lady. (maniacal laughter coming from a man)
Man: You fool. You've falled into my trap. Now you're mine, SpongeBob the strong.
SpongeBob: So, we meet again, Crazyfish.
Jack M. Crazyfish: Bring it on.
SpongeBob: With pleasure. (cracks his knuckles)
Jack M. Crazyfish: (grunts) So loud.
SpongeBob: You ready to get crazy, huh, Crazyfish?
Jack M. Crazyfish: You bet your frosting, Sponge-cake.
SpongeBob: Sorry, I'm not wearing any frosting. (both do a rock-paper-scissors game with SpongeBob winning the first round with paper over rock but Crazyfish changes his rock to scissors) Hey, that's cheating.
Jack M. Crazyfish: No, it's not.
SpongeBob: Yes it is.
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is not...
SpongeBob: Is too...
Jack M. Crazyfish: Is not...
SpongeBob: Is too... (while they argue, the train is getting closer to the woman)
Woman: Um, guys? Guys? The train!
SpongeBob: (jumps next to her) Don't worry. I'm ready. (tears his shirt) Bring it on. (right before the train hits him, his alarm wakes him up from his dream) Oh, good morning, Gare-bear.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I kept you up all night with my nocturnal outbursts? Again?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, no, Tuesday night was the one with the 30-foot librarian. Last night was the one where I defeat notorious arch- villain Jack M. Crazyfish. Using the sheer force of my awesomely developed musculature. (puffs out his chest. Goes to the bathroom and has trouble opening up the toothpaste. He deflates to his normal size and goes to get a wrench from under his alarm clock. Goes back to the bathroom and hits the wrench on the tooth paste, causing the top to ricocheted off some things in the bathroom before hitting SpongeBob in the eye. He looks in the mirror to see if he has a black eye) Whew, what a relief. For a second there I thought I gave myself a black... (slips on the toothpaste top and hits his eye on the wrench.) ...eye. (Looks in the mirror at his black eye. Cries in his bed)
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I'm busy... wallowing.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: I did something so dumb to myself that even you would laugh uncontrollably at me.
Gary: (disagreeing) Meow.
SpongeBob: You promise you won't laugh? (Gary nods) Ok, here goes. (lifts his head off the bed) Gary, I gave myself a black eye trying to open the toothpaste. (Gary restrains from snickering) Thanks for not laughing, Gere. I knew you'd... (Gary leaves through his pet door) Gere...? (cut to SpongeBob leaving his house with pink sunglasses on. He looks around and sees no one around so he walks out but runs into Patrick)
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob. Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh! (takes off the sunglasses and sees SpongeBob's black eye)

SpongeBob, you eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did somebody hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.
SpongeBob: No, no, it's ok, Patrick. He... uh, he learned his lesson. (thinking of the toothpaste)
Patrick: Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?
SpongeBob: Hmm... (thinking of Crazyfish) Jack M. Crazfish. You've never seen anyone like this guy, Patrick. He was about 60 feet tall.
Patrick: (quivering) Oh.
SpongeBob: He was big and mean. Oh, but ol' SpongeBob here knows how to teach a lummox some manners.
Patrick: What did you do?
SpongeBob: I handled him the same way I handle all enormous muscle-bound villains.
Patrick: With tears?
SpongeBob: Uh, no, with a little hi-yah! and a ka-zow! and a gallon of hi-yah, hi-yah, ha! Yeah, he never knew what his him.
Patrick: Then what happened?
SpongeBob: I woke up... Oh, I mean, I...
Patrick: I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed.
SpongeBob: That is exactly what I mean, Patrick. Well, see you later, buddy. (walks off)
Patrick: There goes a real hero.
SpongeBob: (makes karate sounds) Slugger, that's me. (stops a sea cow crossing) What the? (Sandy is riding a sea horse and taming the sea cows)
Sandy: Yee-haw! Get along little fishies.
SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy.
Sandy: Whoa! (sea horse stops) Hot cat snake in a barn. Look at your eye. Land sakes. That's quite a shiner you got there. Well, don't you worry none. I know some natural remedies that'll...
SpongeBob: Keep your natural remedies to yourself. Manly dudes like me don't need 'em. I'll have you know that I got this black eye in a fight.
Sandy: A fight? Well, there's no shame in losing.
SpongeBob: Lose? Sandy, I taught the fish who tangled with me a lesson he shan't soon forget.
Sandy: Why? Did he write it down?
SpongeBob: No, I engraved it on his pain gland.
Sandy: Well, what type of man scuffles boots with you and loses?
SpongeBob: Oh, this was no mere man. He was the notorious outlaw Jack M. Crazfish!
Sandy: Jack M. Crazyfish?
SpongeBob: It all happened late last night... (flashback to last night where SpongeBob is walking down the road) I was walking home from work... alone when all of a sudden, Crazyfish sprang up out of nowhere. He threw a giant tire at the back of my head. (Crazyfish laughs after throwing the tire) Then, he stood over me to gloat. I jumped up and karate kicked his hairpiece right off of its snaps. (Crazyfish walks away crying) He was so ashamed he ran all the way home leaving behind a pool of tears. Which I then proceeded to scoop up in my victory tankard and enjoy a nice refreshing beverage.
Sandy: So how'd you get the black eye then?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah, that's right. I had miscalculated the trajectory of my cup and the straw jabbed me in the eye, giving me this awful shiner. (watch beeps)
Sandy: Well, looks like you're late for your day job, killer.
SpongeBob: Ah, phooey. Late schmate. A tough guy like me can show up to work whenever he wants. Adios. (cut to Krusty Krab)
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty. I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident. (SpongeBob kicks the doors open and looks around trying to look tough) Well, looks like I was right about the accident part. (SpongeBob walks up to a fish and shows the black eye he goy)
Fish: Oh.
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's right, pal, do the right thing. Just keep on walking. (walks up to a table of two fish)
Fish #2: Do you mind? We're trying to have a decent meal here.
SpongeBob: That's right. (SpongeBob walks up to Squidward. Clears his throat)
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm...
SpongeBob: Dah-dah-dah-dah, I'm just gonna stop you right there, Squidward. Spare you the oxygen. We all know you weaker folk can't afford to waste it. (takes the microphone) All right, folks, listen up 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. Tough guys don't like to repeat themselves. I'm talking to you, grandma! (old lady puts down the mustard) Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.
Squidward: Not really.
SpongeBob: All right, who said that? Was it you, grandma?
Squidward: It was me, I said it. (SpongeBob turns around and hisses at Squidward)
SpongeBob: Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who. (flashback to this morning) It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum. (lady screams)
Fish: Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.
Mr. Krabs: He's right.
SpongeBob: Hey, let's save all the questions until the end. As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet. (lady continues to scream while tied to a railroad track) "Don't worry, I'll save you." I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak. (slow howl... thud) And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears. (he cries) The force of his tears was so strong I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face... (one of the tears bounces off a rock and hits SpongeBob in the eye) ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!
Fish #3: Uh, what did you say he looked like again?
SpongeBob: Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...
Fish #3: Little green hat?
SpongeBob: I kind of thought it was teal but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat? (SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward gasp) He's... real.
Jack M. Crazyfish: I'm looking for SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Mr Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive. I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.
Old Lady: I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby. (SpongeBob runs home)
SpongeBob: Hi, Gary. (runs back with toothpaste and wrench) All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess...I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this... (hits the toothpaste with the wrench) Then I was walkin', like this. (walks over to the toothpaste top) And I didn't see where the cap went, like this. (slips on the top and hits himself in the eye with the wrench) So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this. (points to his left eye) Uh... like these. (points to both eyes being black) So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?
Jack M. Crazyfish: Uh, not really. I'm here cause I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty. (cut to SpongeBob bringing a plate with a Krabby Patty with 6 patties on it to Crazyfish)

SpongeBob: One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, mi lord. Served directly to your waiting (slips and throws the patty into Crazyfish's face) Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.

Jack M.Crazyfish: Where I come from we settle things in a different kind of way. (play a game of rock-paper-scissors like before with SpongeBob holding out paper while Crazyfish holds out a rock but changes it to scissors)
SpongeBob: No!!!!!!!!!!!.......

Narrator: Mermaidman and Barnacleboy have been captured by the evil ManRay. (ManRay laughs)...Tickled to the point of wetting themselves and sent on a conveyor belt of doom to their watery grave.
Mermaidman: We cannot escape, Barnacleboy. He's too strong. Like the unbeatable taste of a Krusty Kids meal. (ManRay's maniacal laughter stops)
ManRay: The delicious new treat no mortal can resist?
Barnacleboy: Yup.
ManRay: Ooh, I just love the little pip-squeak patty, small fries, and cold juice product.
Narrator: Of course you do, ManRay. Everyone loves the new Krusty Kids Meal. And for a limited time, get your free toy inside.
ManRay: How can I be evil with flavors this good? (all laugh as the words "Only at the Krusty Krab" appear on screen)
Plankton: Krabs calls that a commercial? Who'd fall for that schlock? (pulls down his periscope) Say...something is going on over there. (a bunch of kids are having fun and playing in the Krusty Krab while watching Mermaidman and Barnacleboy on a big screen)
Squidward: The Krusty Krab welcomes... (reads the card in his hand) the Tarpon twins' birthday party. Here are your Krabby Kids Meals. (all the kids dive in and take Squidward with them)
Plankton: Never trust kids, Squidward. Never trust kids.
Mr. Krabs: Gotta hand it to ya, boy. Gettin' Mermaidman and Barnacleboy to shill for me restaurant was a stroke of genius.
SpongeBob: All in the line of duty, Mr Krabs. (Squidward crawls over to the register with torn uniform) Wasn't it great, Squidward?
Squidward: Great? Those little savages tried to kill me.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but it's soooooo worth it when you get to work in these. (shows his uniform which consists of red underwear and a disguise mask around his eyes)
Plankton: Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this? Karen? My own wife. (Karen is talking and laughing with Mr Krabs) Oh, how Krabs mocks me.
Karen: (opens doors to Chum Bucket)Hi, honey.
Plankton: What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend, KRABS?!
Karen: Oh, pipe down. I just went to get you this happy hero box.
Plankton: Well... (jumps on top of the box) Thanks, babe, you're too good to me. (opens the box and gasps) A Mermaidman action figure? And a Barnacleboy eraser? (plays with the toys) Look at me, I'm Barnacleboy. Look at me, I'm Mermaidman. Krabs... (hits the side of the box with Krabs' picture on it with his new toys) Sure...why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaidman and Barnacleboy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too. (maniacal laughter. Cut to Shady Shoals Rest Home) Ding dong. (door opens. Plankton is wearing a plaid, yellow shirt and a hat) Hello, boys. (Mermaidman and Barnacleboy are snoring then wake up)
Mermaidman & Barnacleboy: What? What-what?
Plankton: Down Here, Fellas!
Mermaidman: Who are you?
Plankton: Oh, Professor Plankton. Door-to-door salesman. (gets out a card) My card.
Mermaidman: (reads card) "Professor Plankton's Personal Products?"
Plankton: Saaaay, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right? (shown an ugly side of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy) I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin. (Barnacleboy's chin has zits and bumps in it) Those chiseled features. (Mermaidman's ears has hair growing out of it and zits all over) That bra. But what's this? Dandruff?
Mermaidman: I've got dandruff?
Plankton: You sure do. (pours laundry soap around his neck) See?
Mermaidman: Oh, MYY! (looks at soap)
Plankton: (lifts up Barnacleboy's hat but sees there is real dandruff under there) Eww. A couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr Plankton's come prepared with "Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door.
Mermaidman and Barnacleboy: Sign us up, Professor.
Plankton: Wise decision, gentlemen. (rubs the shampoo into both of their scalps) Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked. (both are now under Plankton's control) Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder. (tears off the dandruff tag a little on the shampoo bottle) Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo) It's Professor Plankton's Mind Control Shampoo!(laughs) With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas. As my zombies. (laughs. Cut to the Krusty Krab where there is a gigantic line outside and giant Mermaidman and Barnacleboy balloons above the building)
Kids: (chanting) We want Mermaidman! We want Barnacleboy! (kids throw Squidward into the window then chant some more while throwing stuff around)We want Mermaidman! We want Barnacleboy! We want Mermaidman! We want Barnacle..
Mr. Krabs: Uh, hey kids. Uh, well, there's Mermaidman and Barnacleboy... in the ball room. (all the kids run inside the ball room and Mr. Krabs closes the door behind them to keep them inside) SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Go get those awol do-gooders you talked me into hiring and bring their putouts back here on the double.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Back you, back. (the broom he was using to keep the kids back is eaten. Cut to Shady Shoals Rest Home where all of the fish are either running or hiding in fear of Mermaidman and Barnacleboy's destruction of the place)
SpongeBob: Mermaidman and Barnacleboy, please? And I'm kind of in a hurry. (Mermaidman taps him on the shoulder) Aah! (Mermaidman and Barnacleboy growl at him while under Plankton's control) Oh, my gosh! You guys live in a dump. But we don't have time for that right now. We gotta get you back to the Krusty Krab for your special appearance. I'll take you. (Mermaidman takes SpongeBob’s hand and does the Spine Blaster on him.) Wow, I haven't seen you do the Spine Blaster since... (Mermaidman does Spine Blaster on SpongeBob.) since episode 647. (Mermaidman does the Spine Blaster on SpongeBob once again.) When you blasted that guy's spine. You still got it. (Mermaidman and Barnacleboy drag SpongeBob off. Cut to the Krusty Krab)

Perch: Perch Perkins here, live at the Krusty Krab. We're just moments away from an important press conference with Mermaidman and Barnacleboy. I have with me here Eugene Krabs, owner of the restaurant. Any thoughts, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: (muttering gibberish because of all the money in his pocket)
Perch: (chuckles) Oh, oh. We'll come back to you later. (SpongeBob comes crashing down through the ceiling)
SpongeBob: Ladies and gentlemen, I present.. Mermaidman and Barnacleboy. (MM and BB crash through the side of the Krusty Krab. All the kids break through the ball room cage and run up to their heroes. But Mermaidman and Barnacleboy throw them aside and go up to the press conference booths while the cameras flash)
Plankton: (hiding in Mermaidman's right ear) Oh, boy... everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet. (maniacal laughter)
Perch: Mermaidman, what is your opinion of the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: Ooh, this is too easy. Now just tell everyone that... (whispers into his ear)
Mermaidman: I, Mermaidman, think that Krabby Patties are, uh......... what?
Plankton: They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties.
Mermaidman: I'm late for "Snappy Pabbies?" Barnacleboy... we're late for... (snores)
Plankton: Oh, for crying out loud. (walks up to his ear drum) Tell them to hate Krabby Patties!!! (Mermaidman snores then exhales. Plankton gets frustrated and goes through the ear canal)
Mermaidman: What?
SpongeBob: Mermaidman. I got something to refresh your memory.(whispering)
Mermaidman: Ooh, a Krabby Patty. Would you look at that. Barnacleboy, it's a Krabby Patty. Why these things are... (turns under the mind control again) evil! (everyone gasps)
SpongeBob: Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!

Fish: Susie, no! (slaps her patty away)
Mermaidman: I hate these nasty things, (spits on it, SpongeBob becomes broken and cracks into pieces). And furthermore, let it be known that I, Mermaidman, prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket! Our new favorite restaurant!
SpongeBob: The Chum Bucket?!! Plankton must be behind this.
Plankton: Yes.Yeeessssseesss! It's working.(laughs) (the crowd is mumbling disgustedly and exit the Krusty Krab)
SpongeBob: Hold it right there. You forgot your Krabby Patties!
Mermaidman & Barnacleboy: (drool) Krabby Patties. Krabby Patties.
Plankton: Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaidman and Barnacleboy. (Plankton turns a switch to slap Mermaidman from eating a Krabby Patty. He makes him throw one away and then stomp on the other. Then they walk out but are stopped again by SpongeBob)
SpongeBob: Not so fast! You're not dealing with an ordinary fry cook. It's time for you to meet... (throws an exploding capsule on the ground) Fry Boy! Defender of... uh-oh! (notices his outfit is not on so he uses another exploding capsule to put on his suit) Fry Boy! Defender of the Krabby Patty! (Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy run after SpongeBob. SpongeBob throws the patties up into the air and hits them with his spatulas sending them to Mermaidman and Barnacleboy but out heroes duck. SpongeBob stretches his arms around some coral and sends MM and BB back towards him. He trips them into the ground and eating a Krabby Patty) Yes! You lose, Plankton! Now watch as the Krabby Patties' wholesome flavors work their magic. (Barnacle Boy looks at his watch, then they aggressively run to the Chum Bucket)
Plankton: I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers. (evil laugh) In your face, Krabs. Yes!
Fish #2: So, uh... where's the food?
Plankton: (laughs evil) (gasps) Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far. (goes into the kitchen)
SpongeBob: It doesn't make sense. They should have been cured once the pureness of the Krabby Patties entered their... that's it! Mermaidman and Barnacleboy are elderly. Their poor aged tummies must be having a hard time digesting the food. I know just what to do. (crashes through the Chum Bucket's wall with a "fiber" truck and pours fiber into the heroes' mouths. Their stomachs digest the food and they go back to normal)
Mermaidman: I'm back to my old self again. Thanks to you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: And the delicious power of Krabby Patties.
Mermaidman: Say, I could use a couple more of those, and an order of Krabby Fries.
Barnacleboy: (walks out of the bathroom) And a decent latrine.
SpongeBob: Well, then, you guys know where to go!
SpongeBob, Mermaidman, & Barnacleboy: To the Krusty Krab, away! (everyone goes over to the Krusty Krab)
Plankton: Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes! (notices there aren't any customers) (uncontrollably) GRAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

Open at a location which a sign identifies as the Bikini Bottom Dock & Shipyard, where some children are about to go on a trip to somewhere. We then see these children in colorful uniforms waiting in line for a boat. SpongeBob is seen in the uniform, but has piles of luggage. SpongeBob touches his stuff twice gently, and both times let out a small ding of clean-ness. He then claps his hands like he's playing the cymbals, to get rid of the dirt. We then hear a familiar voice:)
Patrick: SpongeBob! (He's running to the dock for SpongeBob.) SpongeBob! (He then falls into the water, and tries to get out, while talking underwater. We then see three of the children fish looking down at him. Patrick then climbs onto the deck where SpongeBob is, and gets up. He's now in front of SpongeBob.) SpongeBob! You forgot to tell me you're leaving! (They both start to have water in their eyes, then very crying-like mouths.)
SpongeBob: Well Patrick, I guess... (Both wobbling in sadness.) ...this is... (Both then hug each other and both start to cry as if they're making a river of tears.)
Patrick: I'm gonna miss you, buddy!
SpongeBob: Me too, Patrick, me too! (In the background, we can start to hear happy music and some marching. We then see what the boat is, and we see the children singing:)
Sun Fun Island, it's so fun
Sun Fun Island, here we come
Sun Fun Island, it's so fun
Sun Fun Island, we can't wait...
(The sign says, "Camp Sun-N-Fun or Bust". Cries of joy can be heard. Confetti starts falling, while SpongeBob and Patrick are still crying. The children can still be heard singing along to the song as the boat leaves. Another boat comes up, but it's metal-plated, and doesn't look too friendly. We then see people wearing black-and-white striped hats and overalls wearing handcuffs, marching to the boat. They look like prisoners. The boat is shown to contain wires with pointed blades on them at the top, and barred windows. At the entrance, we see a warden looking out. SpongeBob and Patrick are still crying. They then suddenly give in, and stop crying.)
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, if I had only known how hard not saying goodbye could be... (SpongeBob then gets an idea, and we hear the idea bell. SpongeBob yells like he got an idea. He then starts stuttering on how good the idea is.)
Patrick: Well, see you later, bud. (SpongeBob grabs him and interrupts.)
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's it! You can come with me to summer camp! Then I'd never have to say goodbye!
Patrick: Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!
SpongeBob: (after a pause) How about now?
Patrick: Yep! (Bubble-wipe to the entrance to the scary boat with the Warden in front of it)
SpongeBob: (to the Warden) ...this stuff is just my carry-on, porter. (We see them smiling, with SpongeBob carrying 2 purses, and Patrick holding a wooden suitcase shaped like a coffin.) The rest of my things are right over there. (SpongeBob points to where they are, and the Warden gets angry, and starts growling. SpongeBob tosses his stuff to the Warden, and runs in. Patrick does the same.

Patrick: Weee! Haha!
SpongeBob: Oh, and porter... thanks! (He tosses a quarter to the Warden. The Warden gets so angry, he burns a hole through the coffin-shaped suitcase. He starts to move his eyes in a swift manner, and tosses all the carry-ons into the water. He goes in, locks the door with metal bars and pointy ends, and leaves with the stuff on the dock. We then see fog everywhere. We see SpongeBob, up close, looking out on the barred window. The camera zooms out, and we see the boat SpongeBob was supposed to be on, with the children still singing)
SpongeBob: Boy, that looked like a boring boat to be on, huh, guys? (He looks back in the boat, and we see the prisoners. SpongeBob is smiling, but the prisoners are not. They're sitting there, on benches in the middle of the room, with annoyed-mean expression on their face. A light bulb is swinging around in the background.) Guys? (We then see lightning strikes, and we see their destination: a small island, filled with rocky, pointy-edged, rocks that seem would kill you if you touched it. There's a fort in the middle, with barbed wire at the top, and an open room in the middle. They're all standing there in a corner. We zoom in there, and the door slams open. We see the warden go in, and as he comes in, we hear his footsteps, and see the prisons watch in silence, with sweat on their face. We then see the warden's boots walking towards them. We get a close up of the people, and see all but SpongeBob and Patrick are having that same look. SpongeBob and Patrick have their mouths shaped like an "o", with them looking at the Warden in amazement. We then see a close-up of the Warden's face, and he has a tense expression on his face.)
Warden: Welcome to Inferno Island! (SpongeBob and Patrick cheer with joy, with clown horns going off.) What in the seven seas just assaulted my eardrums? Could that had been an unrequested sound-off? Well, it must have been my imagination! And you can all thank your lucky stars that... (He gets in their faces) ...I have a very active imagination! Because it so happens that it is my sworn duty to think of fun things to do with the trash that society has thrown away!
SpongeBob: (Whispering to Patrick) I always prefer to recycle. (Everyone starts to snicker, except the Warden. We hear a whistle, and then we pan up to SpongeBob and Patrick.)
Warden: Holy fishpaste! We got ourselves a couple of rabble rousers. What's your name, son?
SpongeBob: (Very happily) SpongeBob SquarePants!
Warden: And are you a rabble rouser?
SpongeBob: (Chuckles for a second) Funny you should ask. Once I had...
Warden: Well I hope you aren't, because you sure look mighty tasty. And it's too soon after breakfast for me to want to chew somebody's head off!
Patrick: (Whispers to SpongeBob) Actually, I am a little hungry.
Warden: Hungry?! Barney, fetch these two poor hungry souls a snack. On the double! (Barney then comes back and throws tires in front of them. SpongeBob and Patrick look at the tires, and we hear bicycle horns going off. We then see the Warden and Barney staring back in awe, and we hear SpongeBob and Patrick eat the tires. Some prisoners stare back in awe.)
Prisoner #1: Ohh. These guys are tough! (We then see SpongeBob and Patrick with full bellies.)
Patrick: The food coma is setting in.
SpongeBob: Yeah. I could use a nap. (The Warden comes up quickly, and startles them.)
Warden: Did you say a nap?! Well, I know the perfect place for you two to go digest that meal. (SpongeBob and Patrick smile in delight. Bubble-wipe to see them both in a hole in the ground that's shaped like a cube, and with a barred window-like door at the top.) A couple days in the hole never hurt anybody. (The door closes, and we go to SpongeBob and Patrick. We see SpongeBob laying on a skeleton.)
SpongeBob: This camp is very upscale! (We then see 3 prisoners carrying a metal tub labeled "chum" on it. At the top, some chum is seen dripping out. We then see the contents of this particular tub of chum contains a bone, shoe, and an eyeball in it. The prisoners then dump it into the hole.)
Patrick: I had no idea they had a hot tub!
(Title card and Narrator: "Three days later")
Warden: Alright! Let them out! (Another guard looking like Barney, who's alongside him, opens the door. The warden looks at the prisoners.) Now pay attention, worms. Watch the way they crawl out on their bellies, begging for mercy, and see what's waiting for you, next time you foul up the same way these two did! (The warden looks at them, only to see SpongeBob and Patrick with their bodies all chunky. SpongeBob's head is like a boxed bubble, and Patrick is all chubby.)
SpongeBob: It was quite an enjoyable soak. That is, until this guy (points to Patrick) got thirsty and decided to drink the bath water!
Patrick: Not bad! Except for this aftertaste. (Patrick's breath reaches its way to the warden who smells it. His eyes get big in disgust. The prisoners also cough, because it smells so bad.)
Warden: Shut your traps, all of ya! Because of that little outburst, I am going to treat you all to an activity so heart-wrenchingly boring and physically exhausting, that it is guaranteed to render your souls broken beyond repair!
SpongeBob & Patrick: YAY! (Bubble-wipe to a mine, where the prisoners are mining the rocks. They all look bored, except for SpongeBob and Patrick.)
SpongeBob: This is a pretty fun camp game, huh Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah!
SpongeBob: It's made even more fun and challenging by the fact that we're wearing these heavy ankle weights. (Cut to a view of Inferno Island, where we see it's storming even worse. We then go to the bunks to see SpongeBob in "bed".)
Warden: (In background) Good night, ladies! (We then hear the prisoners making complaints ranging from "My corns won't stop ringing" to "I miss my rubber ducky". Then SpongeBob pats his pillow, grabs it, and notices that it's made out of paper. SpongeBob gets on the side of his bed and sighs.)
Patrick: (From the bottom bunk) What's wrong, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: The other campers just aren't having as much fun as you and me.
Patrick: If only we could think of some sort of group activity that we can all do together. Then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other. (Patrick rolls to his right, and we hear sliding.) Good night! (We then hear the usual idea noise, and a light bulb appears above SpongeBob's head.)
SpongeBob: That's it! We'll show him we can be self-starters! (Bubble-wipe. We see SpongeBob at a desk, typing on a typewriter, with a lamp on. The clock says 9:00pm. SpongeBob is shown from the typewriter's point of view, with mounds of typed papers, pushing the typewriter keys one by one, with one finger each. The clock then says 7:30am. SpongeBob goes in front of the door labeled "Warden", with his pile of papers in front of him. SpongeBob then slides each paper under the door, one by one, until the whole thing is inside. Then we go to the bunks, and we hear the warden blow his whistle.)
Warden: Rise and shine! (Everyone gets in two straight lines in front of the warden.) Now, which one of you vile, low-down, foul, miserable, wretched swine left this (Shows the papers SpongeBob left in his office) pathetic, worthless, horrid, meaningless... (Breathes deeply.)
SpongeBob: (SpongeBob then raises his right arm, and points with one finger up.) Uh... abomination?
Warden: (Looks behind him) Who said that?
SpongeBob: Me, sir! (Holds up his right arm, while being perky.)
Warden: (Shows the papers) What is the meaning of this thing?
SpongeBob: It's a play, for our amusement and inspiration! (Warden backs up in shock, and then ponders.)
Warden: Hmmmm... of course. Well then, I'll watch your play, and I will enjoy every act of your pathetic, meaningless, ridiculous production. (Turns to his assistant [the same one who released SpongeBob and Patrick from the hole earlier]) You know why?
Assistant: Uhh...because you cherish the fine art of thespianism?
Warden: NO! (Back to SpongeBob) Because it'll be the last act you'll ever perform in your pathetic lives! So, get to it! And I'd better be truly entertained!
SpongeBob: Cool! (Bubble-wipe to see SpongeBob and Patrick working on building a steam-powered boat, while the prisoners are mining.)
Prisoner #3: Kid's wasting his time. (Stops, and notices the boat.)
SpongeBob: All done! (We zoom out, and see that it really is an actual boat.)
Prisoner #3: You thinkin’ what I'm thinkin’?
Prisoner #4: Hmmmmm... 
Prisoner #3: It's a boat, you simpleton! What do boats do?
Prisoner #4: Duh... make smoke?
Prisoner #3: NO! (He slaps #4.) Knucklehead! They float, away from this island, with all of us on board! (All of the prisoners huddle up.) Now, here's the plan... (They whisper in a conference. They then turn to the boat.) Hey, buddy! You need some help?
SpongeBob: Really?
Prisoner #3: Sure!
(Title card and Narrator: "Opening night...")
(Back on Inferno Island. An actual red curtain and stage lights are situated at the dock. We see 3 chairs in the front of it. The Warden and two of the guards all sit down. One of the guards is holding popcorn and the Warden is holding a program that's labeled, "Play Bill". The curtain then rises, and we see SpongeBob looking through a telescope.)
SpongeBob: Aye, four jibs-men, what forces blow the merry winds of Galilee? 
Prisoner #3: (The prisoners are now seen behind the curtains.) Get ready! 
Prisoner #4: Huh? Oh. (The others suddenly become happy as music starts.)
Music: Together

Prisoner:

'Tis we,

Prisoners:

here to sing a song of maritime com-rah-der-ree.

Together! (Patrick plays a wild solo on an electric guitar.)

Together!

Prisoners & SpongeBob:

Together! (Patrick is playing an electric drum set.)

Together! (Patrick strikes a chord on a synthesizer.)

Together! (Lights turn on around the stage, astounding the Warden. As the next scenes play, he becomes increasingly emotional.)

Prisoners, SpongeBob & Patrick:

Together! Together! To-geth-er.

Prisoner:

Like a boat, upon the sea!

Prisoner Chorus:

Together! (They pull the anchor out of the water.)

Another Prisoner Chorus:

In happy camaraderie! (They free the boat from its port.)

Third Prisoner Chorus:

Together! (They are at the steering wheel.)

That's the way, it ought to be!

Fourth Prisoner Chorus:

Together! (They shove coals into the boiler.)

Prisoner:

Just you,

2 Prisoners:

and you,

3 Prisoners:

and you,

4 Prisoners:

and you

Prisoners:

and me!

Together!

Prisoners, SpongeBob & Patrick:

Togeeeetttthhhher! TOGETHER!
(Curtain goes down, and the show ends. The Warden and his guards clap and scream with joy. One of them throw roses at the stage. The Warden starts to cry.)
Warden: I-I-I've never seen anything so beautiful in my... (Breaks down and hugs the guards)
Prisoner #3: OK, let's do it! (They start to sail away.)
SpongeBob: Um... Hey guys, what are you doing? (The boat stops.)
Prisoner #3: We're breaking out of here, that's what! Escaping! Oh, um... thanks for the convincing stage craft! (The boat resumes sailing away. Back to the Warden and the guards still clapping.)
Warden: Encore! Encore! Encore! Do it again! (Curtain rises, revealing that the boat is gone and that SpongeBob and Patrick are standing there all by themselves. The warden notices the escaping prisoners.) What the?! (Seeing that the warden has spotted them, the prisoners try to row faster. But the boat starts to sink, as they attempt to do so.)
Prisoner #3: Turn this ship around! (They attempt to turn around, only to notice that the boat isn't complete, as it only had one side. The boat capsizes into the water, and the prisoners emerge from it, shouting indistinctly that they can't swim. SpongeBob and Patrick bow.)
(Bubble-wipe to see the prisoners standing in line, all wet. The Warden is walking back and forth.)
Warden: I'm stumped. I can't even begin to imagine a punishment appropriate for what has happened here tonight! Words cannot attempt to describe the disgusting, vile, th-th-the complete disregard for the storied tradition of musical theatre. So, starting this very moment, every one of you sub-protozoas will be sentenced to... (Suddenly, a voice yelling "Ahoy!" is heard. The Warden turns around and sees someone through his telescope.)
Camp Counselor: Hello? Yoo-hoo?
Warden: What in the name of... (The Camp Counselor goes up on the deck, raft and all, and attempts to catch his breath after swimming hard.) For Neptune's sake, man, speak the King's English.
Camp Counselor: I'm... I'm Camp Counselor Kraus from Sun Fun Island!
Warden: You're who, what?
Camp Counselor: Well, I was doing roll call and discovered one of my Sun-funners was missing! I came to take him back with me. A SpongeBob, uh, SquarePants? (Seeing a chance, the prisoners all claim to be SpongeBob.)
Warden: ENOUGH! So tell me, Counselor, just what do they do on your Sunny Funny Island?
Camp Counselor: Well, we, uh... make macaroni art...
Warden: Egad.
Camp Counselor: And we sing campfire songs!
Warden: Ahck!
Camp Counselor: Oh, and we help and support each other. (Warden's head explodes with scary thoughts.)
Warden: STOP! These heinous activities sound like torture too severe for even the lowest, filthiest, undeserving... (He gets an idea.) Wait a minute! I have a brilliant idea! (Cut to another campsite. We see glue and macaroni being placed on a paper plate. The prisoners express grunts of disapproval to what they're being forced to do. Cut to Prisoner #4, who has made a smiley face out of the paper plate.)
Camp Counselor: (To Prisoner #4) Oh, that is very good, Bruiser! (We see others complaining and crying. SpongeBob and Patrick sigh.)
SpongeBob: Patrick?
Patrick: (simultaneously) SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: You first.
Patrick: (sigh) I... I liked the other island better!
SpongeBob: Me too! (Both start crying uncontrollably.)

SpongeBob and Patrick:(screaming) Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

Sandy: What the? (SpongeBob and Patrick get inside Sandy's air suit)

(Sandy takes them out and SpongeBob and Patrick are in a muttering worry)

Sandy: Whoa there! Calm down! Tell me what happened.

Patrick: SpongeBob and I are being chased by a monster!

SpongeBob: And he's going to eat us!!!!!!

Sandy: Oh no he ain't!

(The little cricket in a air helmet shows up)

(SpongeBob and Patrick): AAHHH!! Aahhhhh!!! There it is!

(Sandy laughs) Sandy: This little guy? Why, it's just a little cricket, he's a land creature just like me! The poor thing must have gotten lost. Oh, he's not going to hurt ya. See?(SpongeBob and Patrick faint when Sandy shows them the cricket)

Sandy: Aahh, let's get you back home you little fella. (blows a bubble to the grasshopper) There you go!See, that wasn't nothin' to be scared of, huh guys?

(SpongeBob and Patrick cry!)

Sandy: (sighs) I don't have time for this, I'm late for my survival training camp.

SpongeBob: Survival training camp??!! Patrick and I love camping!

Patrick: Can we come???!!

Sandy: This is ain't no ordinary camping trip, I go out into the wild armed only with my bare hands, my quick wits, this harpoon, and 65 pounds of dynamite(shows the dynamite). Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten. You have to be willing to do anything when you're alone in the wild. You two wouldn't last a single day!

SpongeBob: Hey!

Patrick: Would so!

SpongeBob: We'll have you know that just the other day Squidward commented at our survival skills!

(goes into flashback)

Squidward: You two are harder to get rid of than cockroaches!

SpongeBob: Thank you Squidward!

(SpongeBob and Patrick walk away)

Squidward: Grr! Grr! Agrr!! Grrr! (mutters while pinning on the SpongeBob and Patrick voodoo dolls) Why aren’t these things working?!

(End of flashback)

Sandy: No way guys! This is a serious trip for hard-working survivalists only!

SpongeBob and Patrick: But Sandy!!!

Sandy: No!

SpongeBob and Patrick: (Moans)

(Sandy drives on her jeep, but SpongeBob and Patrick are already on it)

(SpongeBob and Patrick laugh)

SpongeBob: Shhh!! We'll show Sandy we're tough as she is!

(SpongeBob and Patrick have a rough shaking)

SpongeBob: I guess the road smoothed out.

(The mountain Sandy is driving on is upside down, and SpongeBob and Patrick are screaming, fall from the truck, but drop in)

SpongeBob: That was a close one Patrick! Almost left in the wilderness....without Sandy! Nobody would know where to find us!

Patrick: Weird. There's a door back here too?

SpongeBob: No Patrick No!

(SpongeBob and Patrick scream and are drop with Food Box, water bottle, and tent after Patrick opens the door)

SpongeBob: Sandy wait! Sandy!!!!!!!Sandy!!!! Well, at least we have food, shelter, and water. I'll fix the tent while you start the campfire. Then when we're all done, I'll cook us some grub. Okay Patrick, we're almost done. We have fresh water, a tent for shelter....

Patrick: And a nice fire to keep us warm.

SpongeBob: Say, where did you get the firewood? (SpongeBob looks at the food box) You burnt our food supply??!!!! Oh-no! Quick! Quick! Cover it over something! Aahhh! Aahhh!! (Patrick puts the tent over the fire)Hey Patrick, nice job. (The fire burns the tent) AHHHHHHH!!!! (SpongeBob puts the water over the water bottle and their supplies are wasted)

SpongeBob: Whew! Uh-oh, well, we burnt our food, ruined our tent, and lost all our water. Patrick, we're going to need to use our razor-sharp quick wits if we're going to make it out of here alive!

Patrick: Gotcha.

SpongeBob: Okay. Here's the plan..

Patrick: Oh, no! No! No! Whoa! Whoa! You made the last decision! My turn.

SpongeBob: Sure Patrick, what do you think we should do??

Patrick: Um...maybe,........uh.........

SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick?

Patrick: Oh, for crying out loud SpongeBob! I didn't rush you when it was your turn!

SpongeBob: Sorry, sorry, take your time. (months pass, many nights have gone, winter come, and they become old)

Patrick: Uhhh.. (rain and thunderbolts come) Oh shoot! I forgot what I was going to say!

SpongeBob: No hurry Patrick.

Patrick: Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?

SpongeBob: Sure. Let's go play in that cave over there.

(They go to the cave)

SpongeBob: I like it here. It's rooooooomy, and best of all, we have this cave all to ourselves.

Strange Voice: Ahh, hoo-heeheeheeheeheehee.

SpongeBob: Huh? Mice. We'll have the night here, and head home tomorrow.

Old Cave Fish: Home? This is your new home. You'll be here forever just like me! (laughs) (Patrick joins his laughing. )

Patrick: Aahh, good times.

SpongeBob: What do you mean we'll be here forever? How long have you been here?

Fish: 40 years I've been here. There's ain't no way out of this valley. You’re stuck in here’ with me for the rest of your lives!

SpongeBob: We're stuck in here forever? We're doomed!'

Patrick: Are you kidding? That old crook's been here for years! Look at him: he's in great shape! Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health.

SpongeBob: You're right Patrick, but what are we going to eat, where will we sleep?

Patrick: I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here. (goes inside his rock home)

SpongeBob: Patrick's right. If I'm stuck here, I should make the best of it. I'll build myself a new home.(builds sand home that looks like his Pineapple Home only made out of sand and has some texture and details, but it is connected to the ground) There, just like my pineapple in Bikini Bottom.....only, smaller,(grunts because he sits on the top of the sharp leaves of the sand pineapple home) comfy, safe and sound in my own little home.

Cave Fish: Safe? You're never safe out in the wild! If I were you, I'd keep an eye on that big fella.

SpongeBob: Patrick? Do'h! Patrick is my best friend! He wouldn't hurt me.

Cave Fish: He's a big boy! Wait until when he gets hungry! It's eat or be eaten! (Patrick chews on his arm)

SpongeBob: Aaahhhhh!!!! He's got the taste of flesh!

SpongeBob: Hey Patrick.

Patrick: Hey SpongeBob. (his stomach growls)

SpongeBob: Sounds like you're hungry.

Patrick: Oh, boy am I! I'm soooooo hungry, I could eat anything! I could eat an entire sponge..

SpongeBob: Aah-aaahhhhh!!!! (runs away)

Patrick: ...cake. I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him. It has delicious cream filling too! (eats the cake)

SpongeBob: It's all true! Patrick is going to eat me! What should I do?

Cave Fish: You've got to protect yourself! What you need is a fort!

SpongeBob: This fort replica of the Krusty Krab should protect me from that fiend: Patrick! Aahh! He's onto me! Must hide! (hides in the sand replica of the Krusty Krab). Ha,ha, I'm safe, Patrick can't get me in here, (laughs), I don't need to go outside, I have everything I need right here! (makes tools out of sand), Spatula, (makes a sand patty), now I just need some buns, (makes sand buns, takes a bite) oh, crunchy. (spits the patty out) I can't take it! (blows up the sand replica of the Krusty Krab). I need some real food!

Cave Fish: Remember kid, it's eat or be eaten.

SpongeBob: Yes! Yes! I shall eat Patrick before he eats me!

(SpongeBob fries Patrick's arm on a pan while Patrick is sleeping)

(Patrick smells the tasty aroma of his hand frying in smoke by SpongeBob's frying pan)

Patrick: Something smells good. What are you cooking SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: I'm gonna cook you up and eat ya!

Patrick: AAHH! Why do you want to eat me?

SpongeBob: I know what you're doing, you're playing dumb, but it won't work, because I'm going to eat you before you eat me!

Patrick: Well not if I eat you first!

SpongeBob: Oh no you don't! (hurries to get Patrick) Where'd he go? Come on out, Patrick. You can't hide forever! What's this? (realizes he's in a warm boiling pot of water),warm water?

Patrick: You seem kinda tense, so I made you a hot tub of water.

SpongeBob: Ah thanks Patrick! I did get a trifle unhinged, didn't I?

Patrick: Oops, I forgot the bath beads! (Chops carrot)

SpongeBob: Thanks Patrick! You're a real pal! Funny looking bathbeads. They almost look like carrots. (Notices carrots) CARROTS?! You're making soup out of me!

Patrick: No it's not! It was supposed to stew!! (runs, then becomes tired) Whew! I'm getting tired.

SpongeBob: Why don't you take a nap on this nice, soft bed?(it's a white wheat bread), there, that's it. And theres a nice soft blanket(it's another white wheat bread with a toothpick and olive), and what's a blanket without a little ketchup? (Makes weird sound that sounds like he is saying "Nee" rapidly)

Patrick: This isn't a bed!

SpongeBob: Wait! Come back! You're not completely seasoned! (Patrick grabs the ketchup bottle and sprays ketchup all over SpongeBob) AAHHH! AAAHHH! (runs away from Patrick) (SpongeBob grabs back the ketchup bottle)

Patrick: Give me that ketchup back!

SpongeBob: No!

(SpongeBob and Patrick fight over the ketchup bottle, and cover each other with ketchup)

SpongeBob: Gotcha! (tries to bite Patrick)

Patrick: No, got you! (tries to bite SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: I got you! (tries to bite Patrick)

(The Cave Fish claps his hands)

Cave Fish: Congratulations! You did it!

SpongeBob: Did what?

Patrick: What?

Cave Fish: Earned your survivalist medals, of course! Only a hard core survivalilist would break down and eat his best pal!

Patrick: Why do you care if we're survivalists?

Cave Fish: Cause I’m not just some old hermit. I'm (rips her costume out, revealing that he is Sandy) Sandy Cheeks! Survivalist extraordinaire!

SpongeBob and Patrick: Sandy?

Sandy: It was no accident that you fell out of truck, I was just testing your survival skills.

SpongeBob and Patrick: You planned this?

Sandy: Yup. And I'm happy to say that you both passed! Here's your survivalist medals! (gives them their medals)

(SpongeBob and Patrick cheer)

SpongeBob: Wow! It's great to have our medals, but I'm still hungry. (picks up his ketchup bottle)

Patrick: Me too.

(SpongeBob and Patrick plan to eat Sandy)

Sandy: Guys? What'd ya doing? Aah, fellas?

SpongeBob and Patrick: Eat or be eaten!!

Sandy: Uh-oh! Next time I'll bring more granola! (runs away from the cave)

(Act 1 starts at the Krusty Krab)

SpongeBob: Backing up! (Walks backward, face to the ground, and imitates a truck backup alarm) Boop, Boop, Boop, Boop, Boop, Boop, Boop, Boop...

Squidward: You're better off not knowing.

SpongeBob: ...Boop, Boop, Boop! (Flips over and puts a tray on a customer's table) Your Krabby Patty, sir.

Fish 1: Do you always serve your food this way?

SpongeBob: You mean with a smile? Yes, sir! (Patrick walks in on a pretend horse)

Patrick: Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, the mollusks are coming! Tally, ho! (Rides around the Krusty Krab) The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! THE MOLLUSKS ARE COMING!

SpongeBob: NOT THE MOLLUSKS!

Patrick: Mollusks? What mollusks?

SpongeBob: There aren't any mollusks coming, are there, Patrick?

Patrick: Nope. I was only pretending to be my famous Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks! (A flashback begins with Patrick Revere riding through town)

Patrick Revere: The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming!

Patrick: It's too bad nobody listened to him.

Fish 2: What beeth the deal with ye olde nutcase? (Mollusks come in and fishes 2 and 3 scream) (Flashback ends)

SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick. I didn't know you had a famous relative.

Patrick: Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.

Mr. Krabs: That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The Spendthrift Billfold System! Allow me to demonstrate. (Pulls out what appears to be a dollar bill from his wallet.) Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?

SpongeBob: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: Ah-ah-ah! Watch. (Pulls on the dollar and a steel jaw trap grabs Mr. Krabs' finger) See?

SpongeBob: Doesn't that hurt?

Mr. Krabs: Every time!

SpongeBob: Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family.

Patrick: Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell. (Bubble-wipe to see SpongeBob standing by a statue that looks like someone riding a seahorse, covered in jellyfish poop)

SpongeBob: I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor. Sigh I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out. (Sandy jumps in making karate-style movements)

Sandy: HI-YAH!

SpongeBob: Hi, Sandy.

Sandy: Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop.

SpongeBob: Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?

Sandy: I sure do! My great Aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas. (Flashback begins with a live-action squirrel standing on top of an oil tower)

Rosie Cheeks: She's ready to blow! (Oil spurts out of the ground and Rosie Cheeks jumps away. Flashback ends to SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.

Sandy: Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree.

SpongeBob: Well, there was my Uncle Sherm. (Pulls out a wallet full of pictures) He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose. (Shows a picture of Uncle Sherm with a watermelon in his nose.)

Sandy: That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Lets do a little digging around your family tree. (Bubble-wipe to Bikini Bottom Library, where Sandy pulls out a book.)

Sandy: "Family Histories of Bikini Bottom". (Reads from the book) Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants... Hey, looky here! (Points to a statue of SpongeBuck in a picture)

SpongeBob: Gasp!

Sandy: It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!

SpongeBob: I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?

Sandy: Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch. That's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days. (A flashback begins with a train coming into scene) It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town. (Train stops; SpongeBuck gets off.)

SpongeBuck SquarePants: Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.

Sandy: (narrating) Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good galoot, Dead Eye!

SpongeBuck: Shoo-Wee! This place sure is big and fancy-like! Gee, willikers! They got an ice cream parlor! (Sees a building that says "Dead Eye Funeral Parlor". Scroll down to another sign reading Ice Cream Parlor". SpongeBuck walks up to the front) I'll take one scoop of vanilly ice cream, please.

Fish 4: You're new here, aren't you?

SpongeBuck: Yep. I just got off from the train.

Fish 4: You don't say. (Gives SpongeBuck the ice cream. As SpongeBuck licks it, the fish measures SpongeBuck and makes a coffin for him. SpongeBuck exits and notices that some people are looking at him. He looks at them, and the others pull their hats down. SpongeBuck keeps walking and licking until he stops at a place full of music. That music is coming from a place called the Krusty Kantina)

Mr. Krabs' western ancestor: Business is good today! (SpongeBuck walks in, ringing the bell by the door as he enters. Everyone stops)

SpongeBuck: Howdy do, y'all?

Squeeze Tentacles: Great, another hayseed.

Mr. Krabs' ancestor (Whispering to Squeeze): Charge him double for his drinks.

SpongeBuck: Howdy partner! (Sits down) Pardon, but is this stool taken?

Fish 5: Yeah. Some fancy dude just sat in it. (SpongeBuck looks at the stool and smiles)

Squeeze: What can I get you, stranger?

SpongeBuck: Give me a shot... of milk.

Squeeze: Milk?

SpongeBuck: Two percent.

Squeeze: Think you can handle it?

SpongeBuck: I drink this stuff every day. Over the lips and through the gums, look out tapeworm, here it comes! Get ready Tapey. (Laughs and drinks the milk, which spills into his stomach, where a worm is living. SpongeBuck yells and falls off the stool) Oh, yeah! Smooth.

Squeeze: Right.

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: What brings you to Dead Eye Gulch, stranger?

Squeeze: Strange is right.

SpongeBuck: The name's SpongeBuck. I left home to make my way here in the big city. I'm here for the job. (Holds up a paper that says 'Sheriff Wanted')

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Wonderful! You're hired. (Gives him a badge) Hey everybody! Meet our new sheriff! (Everyone cheers)

SpongeBuck: Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job. (Holds up the same paper but points to a small section that says 'Fry cook wanted Low pay/No Benefits') Back home, I'm known for my rootin'-tootin', never-pootin' chili. The spiciest chili west of the old red barn. (Mr. Krabs' ancestor tries it and spits it out)

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.

SpongeBuck: In a good way?

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: No, in a terrible way. Look, we already gave you the badge. And the law of the west says: no take backs!

Squeeze: Since when?

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: (Shushes Squeeze) Shhhhhh! (Back to SpongeBuck) So that means, you're the new sheriff!

SpongeBuck: What happened to the old sheriff?

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Uh, he's at Boot Hill.(Points out the window to a cemetery with a sign saying Boot Hill)

SpongeBuck: Gasp! And, why is he at Boot Hill?

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Because Old Dead Tree Hill was totally full. (Points out another window to a full cemetery with a sign saying Old Dead Tree Hill. Pecos Patrick bursts in)

Pecos Patrick: He's a-comin'! Dead Eye's a-comin'!

Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Dead Eye?!

Mr. Krabs' ancestor and Squeeze: Dead Eye?!

SpongeBuck: Who's Dead Eye?

Pecos Patrick: I'll tell you who Dead Eye is! But I shall do it through song. Maestro, if you please. (Squeeze bows, sits at a player piano and cracks his knuckles. He is about to play, when he deposits a coin into the machine. Music starts playing)

Song: "Dead Eye"

Pecos Patrick:
Oh, Bikini Gulch was a purty place
With sweet water and blue sky.
'Til one day a beast come a-riding from the east
By the name of Ol' Dead Eye.
Chorus:
That dirty, no-good Dead Eye!
Pecos Patrick:
Oh, he's robbed this town,
He's pulled my pants down!
Mrs. Puff's western ancestor:
He made all the pretty girls cry! (sobs)
Mr. Krabs' ancestor:
That no-good goon wants my saloon!
And me I.O.U's due tomorrow noon!
If we don't get some help here real soon,
Chorus:
We'll lose everything we own to Dead Eye!
We'd stop him if we weren't too scared to try!
Pecos Patrick:
And if you think that's funny,
Well, let me tell you, sonny,
You won't be laughing when you SEE... (the patrons gasp)
HIS... (another gasp)
BIG... (gasp)
RED... (gasp)
DEAD EYE!
Chorus:
Dead Eye!
(On cue, Dead Eye Plankton comes through the door)

Dead Eye: That's me! Dead Eye Plankton!

Pecos Patrick: Who?

Squeeze: We just sang a whole song about him!

Dead Eye: Well, what are you looking at?! (Everyone hides. Dead Eye knocks a chair with a person down, then pulls off Pecos Patrick's clothes)

Pecos Patrick: Aw, again? (Dead Eye flings checkers pieces in the air and flings them at the milk glasses with his whip. Squeeze and Mr. Krabs' ancestor duck)

Dead Eye: Get up you two! I'm here for my... money, Krabs (dips a coin in milk and bites on it).

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: (Laughs nervously) What? How am I supposed to keep the deed to me saloon if you keep taking all me mortgage payments? I'm going broke here! (Dead Eye bends the coin)

Dead Eye: That's the idea! (Laughs) I thought we were all clear on that.

Mr. Krabs' Ancestor: Oh, yeah. (Hands Dead Eye a bag of money)

Dead Eye: I'll be back at high noon tomorrow for the deed!

SpongeBuck: Hey! That's not your money!

Dead Eye: WHO SAID THAT?! (Mr. Krabs' ancestor points at SpongeBuck and everyone runs away) Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch, not Yokelburg! (Laughs) Yokelburg... (Laughs again) Who are you anyway?

SpongeBuck: I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili?

Dead Eye: Sheriff! (Knocks down SpongeBuck's chili) 'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!

SpongeBuck: Coffin jockeys!? (Runs over to Mr. Krabs' ancestor) You didn't say anything about that! (exits)

Dead Eye: (Pulls out a pocket watch) That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.

SpongeBuck: (Pretending to ride a coffin as if it were a horse) Hope I haven't missed the first post. Whoa, girl! (Coffin neighs like a horse)

Dead Eye: Where do you get these guys? (Mr. Krabs' ancestor shrugs) All right, kid. I'm going to make it simple for you. I'm a villain, got it?

SpongeBuck: Uh huh.

Dead Eye: And this town ain't big enough for the both of us! Understand?

SpongeBuck: Yep.

Dead Eye: So, vamoose! Or we're going to have to settle this western-style at high noon, savvy?

SpongeBuck: Sounds great!

Dead Eye: You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

SpongeBuck: Nope.

Dead Eye: Sigh (Cracks whip at SpongeBuck. The coffin runs away, carrying SpongeBuck with it) And stay out! (checks his watch again) Hey, only three seconds off my record! (Everyone is looking at Dead Eye) What are you hayseeds looking at? (cracks whip and everyone screams and runs away) Git! Get out of here!

Fish 6: What's gonna happen to the town now, pa?

Fish 7: I ain't your pa. (Both scream and run away)

Dead Eye: I love this town! (Laughs evilly and cracks his whip at the camera. End of Act 1.)


(Act 2 begins in the desert, and SpongeBuck is still riding the coffin like a horse)

SpongeBuck: Whoa, gal, whoa! Whoa! (Trips on a rock) Looks like the end of the trail. We're out of food... (shows his arm, with no hand) ...water, and lip balm! (Lip balm turns to dust. SpongeBuck's lips crack and break off) I'm sorry old Pine! Guess I'm gonna have to put you out of your misery! (takes out a saw) So long old friend! (Is about to saw coffin in half when...)

Cowbone 1: Hey, buddy, better be careful. Heat does funny things to your head.

SpongeBuck: It does?

Cowbone 2: Oh, don't listen to that guy, kid! He's looney! (Both laugh. SpongeBuck joins in and then sees Pecos Patrick also laughing)

Pecos Patrick: Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!

SpongeBuck: I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing. (Pecos Patrick slaps him)

Pecos Patrick: Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me! (Cut to a crudely-drawn picture of Pecos Patrick saying "Duuhh".)

SpongeBuck: I don't know... (Pecos Patrick slaps him again) Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurting me! Besides, you're right! It's time I looked fate in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!

Pecos Patrick: Hop on, buddy! (SpongeBuck gets on Pecos Patrick's double-wide coffin)

SpongeBuck: Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.

Pecos Patrick: Don't worry. I got a short cut. He-ya! (Starts riding coffin, which rides them off a cliff. Both land on a cactus, yell in pain and jump very high in the direction of Dead Eye Gulch. There we see a carriage riding around town, with the ancestors of both Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs, as well as Squeeze, inside)

Mrs. Puff's ancestor: Why are we going so fast?

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: 'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs! (Dead Eye is in the road)

Dead Eye: (Laughs evilly) Great idea! (Whipping is heard. Bubble-wipe. Mr. Krabs' ancestor, Mrs. Puff's ancestor, and Squeeze have been stripped down to their underclothes) Okay, let's see... (checking off a list) Personal possessions, clothes off your backs... That should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. (Starts dancing) Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!

Squeeze: I gotta admit, he's got skills.

Dead Eye: That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives! (laughs but then coughs) Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-haw! (Rides off)

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: So, that's it.

Mrs. Puff's ancestor: We lost.

Squeeze: I don't know how it could get any worse. (SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick come screaming to the ground)

SpongeBuck: Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!

Pecos Patrick: We're heroes!

Squeeze: You're morons!

Mrs. Puff's ancestor: It's too late. Plankton's taken everything!

SpongeBuck: But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon.

Mrs. Puff's ancestor: Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm.

Squeeze: And all our stuff.

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: And me money! (sniffs sadly) Me beautiful, beautiful money!

SpongeBuck: You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Could you get to the point? We're freezing!

SpongeBuck: What I'm a-sayin' is: if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Well, I think we all know the answer.

All: Forget it, SpongeBuck!

Pecos Patrick: Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! (Strips to his pajamas and brandishes a pillow) Pillow fight! (Whacks Squeeze with his pillow, laughs, then whacks SpongeBuck)

SpongeBuck: That pillow sure packs a wallop!

Pecos Patrick: It's made out of wood, (Pulls out a wooden log inside the pillow) like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?

SpongeBuck: I do believe I'd sit this one out.

Pecos Patrick: Looks like it's just you and me, kid. (Whacks himself with the log)

SpongeBuck: Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together!

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: No offense, kid. But your advice is as terrible as your chili.

SpongeBuck: I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And together we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! (whispering) Bzbzbzbzbzb

Pecos Patrick: Uh huh...

SpongeBuck: Bzbzbzbzbzbzb

Pecos Patrick: Uh huh, uh huh...

SpongeBuck: Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb

Squeeze: Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying "bzbzbzbzbzbzb"?

SpongeBuck: Umm...

Squeeze: You don't have a plan, do you?

SpongeBuck: No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far. (Everyone groans) But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!

Dead Eye: Oh, I am terrified.

All: Dead Eye Plankton?!

Dead Eye: So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.

SpongeBuck: You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right, g-- Hey! (Sees all of SpongeBuck's friends hiding at the Krusty Kantina)

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: We're right behind you boy! WAY, WAY behind you!

Dead Eye: So, it's come to this. Mano y mano.

SpongeBuck: Well, you can hold the mano, because it's come down to you and me!

Dead Eye: Well, well, well, look at the time! High noon! (A clock strikes 12:00. Dead Eye and SpongeBuck walk toward each other until SpongeBuck steps on Dead Eye) Ow! (Everyone who's hiding look at SpongeBuck, then come out and cheer) I hate all of you!

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Can I try?

Dead Eye: You can't do this! (Steps on Dead Eye)

Pecos Patrick: Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!

Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! (bubble-wipe to the Krusty Kantina, where Mr. Krabs' ancestor is holding a line for patrons to step on Dead Eye)

Mr. Krabs: Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on ol' Dead Eye Plankton! (Several patrons give a dollar each)

Dead Eye: (we see the patrons stepping on him) Ah! Ouch! Ooh!

Mrs. Puff's ancestor: Take that, you no-good little varmint!

Dead Eye: I have a lot of money! (Gets stepped on)

Pecos Patrick: Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town. (SpongeBuck drinks a glass of milk, but Pecos Patrick spills his. Both say "Ahh" in contentment)

SpongeBuck: You forgot the most important part. I discovered the power of idiot friendship. (A crudely-drawn picture of them both going "Duuh" is displayed)

Pecos Patrick: Come with me, I want to show you something. (Cut to outside the Kantina)

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Thank you, sheriff SpongeBuck, for saving our town. And for stepping on that little varmint.

Dead Eye: History will vindicate me! (Gets stepped on by Pecos Patrick)

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor. (Pulls off a sheet revealing a golden statue of SpongeBuck on a coffin)

Citizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Oooh!

Squeeze: I liked my design better. (Shows a piece of paper with his idea on it. The drawing is actually of himself)

Mr. Krabs' ancestor: Sorry about the whole tricking you into being sheriff thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it. (Puts another badge reading "Fry Cook" on SpongeBuck)

SpongeBuck: Wow! Fry cook! (Everyone starts clapping) Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say "Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!"

Citizens of Bikini Gulch: Aaw!

Fish 8: Say seaweed! (Picture is taken and the flashback ends)

SpongeBob: So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch and everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. (Sandy and SpongeBob walk out of the library) It was much better than that one we have now. (Both walk by the statue SpongeBob saw earlier)

Sandy: Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop.

SpongeBob: Wait a minute! (Goes over and starts to pick at the jellyfish poop)

Sandy: Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?! (SpongeBob wipes the poop off the statue to reveal gold) That boy ain't hooked up right.

SpongeBob: Look, Sandy!

Sandy: HUH? (The statue is revealed to be the SpongeBuck statue)

SpongeBob: SpongeBuck was here all along! Sorry Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop.

Sandy: Wow!

SpongeBob: I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!

Sandy: Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming.

(Fade out. Fade in to the Krusty Kantina where SpongeBuck is on stage, riding a coffin)

SpongeBuck: Hey, everybody! It's good to be here at the Krusty Kantina! We got a real special show for y'all tonight! Featuring my new best pal, this guy! (Pecos Patrick gets on stage, also riding a coffin) He's an idiot! (Everyone cheers)

Pecos Patrick: So, what are we gonna sing about, SpongeBuck?

SpongeBuck: We're gonna sing a song about friends!

Pecos Patrick: What kind of friends, SpongeBuck?

SpongeBuck: Well, listen up and I'll tell you!

Song: Idiot Friends

SpongeBuck:
Who's there for you when you are sad and down?
Skull Chorus:
Idiot Friends!
Pecos Patrick:
Who picks you up and slaps you all around?
Flower Chorus:
Idiot Friends!
SpongeBuck:
Who puts thorns in you so you can save the town?
Pecos Patrick:
Idiot Friends,
Idiot Friends,
All:

Pecos Patrick:
Duh, duh duh duh du duh duh do
All:

Pecos Patrick:
Dah de da da da da da do
All:

Pecos Patrick:
De da da da-doodle, duh do
Pecos Patrick: You know SpongeBuck, all we've been singing about is what I've done for you. Well, what have you done for me? (Dead Eye pulls his pants down and laughs evilly)

SpongeBuck:
Who helps you pick your pants up off the ground?
Pecos Patrick: Thanks, buddy!

Dead Eye: Curses!

Pecos Patrick: Only and idiot friend would do that!

SpongeBuck: Let's bring it home, idiot friend!

Pecos Patrick: Okay.

(The music begins)

SpongeBuck:
Who lets you ride on his coffin,
Pecos Patrick:
Slaps you hard and often?
SpongeBuck:
What do you and me have in common?
Both:
We're idiot friends!
(Everyone Cheers)

SpongeBuck: Thank you, thank you very much. (End of act 2)

(in Jellyfish Fields)

SpongeBob: Breaker, breaker outer perimeter, looks clear. Over.

Patrick: Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald. Ryan.

SpongeBob: Are you sure you're not trying to say Roger?

Patrick: Oh, wait I got it. Ringo...

SpongeBob: Patrick, we have visual contact. Now taking evasive action. Subject still in close proximity. Over.

Patrick: Hello?

SpongeBob: Please reply.

Patrick: I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.

SpongeBob: Please, contact imminent Patrick. Respond now. Please. Please!

Patrick: SpongeBob, you're going to need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.

SpongeBob: But I can't speak up Patrick, there's a jellyfish here and I'm worried it might sting me if I make any loud... (SpongeBob bumps Patrick and he screams)... noises.

Patrick: Oops. (they run away. The jellyfish shrugs it off.)

SpongeBob: Is he still after us, Patrick?

Patrick: I don't know, buddy.

SpongeBob: Should we turn around and check?

Patrick: Ok. (they trip over something)

SpongeBob: Oh, I think I landed on my pain center.

Patrick: I think I landed on a rock.

SpongeBob: Patrick, look! There's a weird thing sticking out of the ground right there.

Patrick: That's just Squidward sunbathing again. (Squidward lowers down his sunglasses)

SpongeBob: No, not that, Patrick. This!

Patrick: What is it?

SpongeBob: I don't know. I think there's something buried underneath it. And I'm gonna go get some shovels so we can dig it up.

Patrick: We?

(cut to large piles of dirt)

SpongeBob: Phew! Nothing like a little manual labor to put some hair on your chest, eh, Patrick?

Patrick: I'll say. (his entire chest is covered with hair)

SpongeBob: Plus, look at what we unearthed! A UFO! (look inside) Go on, you first. (Patrick climbs down a ladder) Kinda dark, huh?

Patrick: Yeah, dark.

SpongeBob: Well, there has to be a light switch around here somewhere. Found it. Excuse me, sir. (pulls off a skeleton and proceeds to start the submarine) Hey, Patrick, look! We're moving! And here's the steering wheel!

Patrick: Hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.

SpongeBob: Gimme that wheel!

Patrick: No! Let go! I wanna drive! (the submarine goes crazy)

(scene cuts to the Krusty Krab)

Mr. Krabs: I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prostegious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.

Squidward: Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen just for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.

Squidward: Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?

Mr. Krabs: Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?

Squidward: La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

Mr. Krabs: Yes, of course! But how? (the submarine crashes into the Krusty Krab)

SpongeBob: Can we park here? Hey, Mr. Krabs! Look what Patrick and I found! We're gonna use it to go on a long journey.

Patrick: Or even around the block!

Mr. Krabs: That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road. (cut to outside) So long, lad. Make me lots of money!

SpongeBob: Bye, Squidward. Bye, Mr. Krabs. (dreamily) Bye, Squidward.

Patrick: You said "Bye, Squidward" twice.

SpongeBob: I like Squidward.

Plankton: (looking through a telescope) A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take........ his turn. (laughs and turns the fist from the Chum Bucket building into a flying vehicle)

SpongeBob: Hello!

Man: Hello.

SpongeBob: Could I interest you in a Krabby Patty?

Man: No thanks.

Patrick: Now what?

SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Mr. Krabs said if we didn't find customers, not to come back. (to Con Man) Uh, are you sure you don't want to be out first customer, sir?

Man: Yeah, I'm pretty sure. (walks away)

SpongeBob: Wait! We'll pay you!

Man: Hey, thanks again, you guys. Good luck with the restaurant!

SpongeBob: Thank you, very much sir, come again soon!

Plankton: Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected. (an alarm sets off)

Voice: Customer approaching.

Plankton: Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?

Boy: Uh, does it come in raspberry?

Plankton: Um, no.

Boy: Blueberry?

Plankton: (Angrily) No.

Boy: Uh...raspberry?

Plankton: Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already!!!! Now quit wasting my time!!!

Lady Fish: Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are!!?

Plankton: I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers!!!

Man Fish: Hey, you can't talk about my wife that way!!! What do you think this is!?!?!

Plankton: It's time for you to lose some weight fatty!! That's what this is.

Grandma: Hey, you can't talk about my grandson that way! Somebody oughta put you in a mental hospital.

Plankton: Somebody should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!!

Grandma: You're probably right.

Plankton: You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here. (people start throwing rocks) What the? No! Controls malfunctioning!

SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.

Patrick: Yeah?

SpongeBob: Weren't you supposed to be on kitchen duty? (cut to the kitchen, where the patties are burnt) Oh, no. You burnt all the patties. It's hard as a rock. How are we going to find someone who would buy these?

Man Fish: Hey, the rocks are all gone.

Crowd: Aww! (Plankton smiles)

SpongeBob: Folks, have I got a deal for you. (the crowd sees the hard patties. they buy them and proceed to hit Plankton with them)

Jack: Alright, let's get him!

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is going to be so proud of us when he finds out how good we're doing. Did you see any new customers, Patrick?

Patrick: No, but I see a sign. It says. "Warning: Ab... eyes?"

SpongeBob: Let me see. (looks through periscope) No, Patrick, that says "Abyss."

Patrick: OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: An abyss is a bottomless...(the submarine falls down the abyss)...chasm! (an alarm goes off) Pat, we're falling!

Patrick: And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!

Plankton: (sees it falling) Yes! Yes!

Patrick: And now a deafening warning siren! (SpongeBob imitates the sound. the submarine hits a sludgy item, which turns out to be the head of the Sea Monster)

Sea Monster: (shouts)

SpongeBob: Look, Patrick! We've floated back up, out of the deep, dark, depressing, horrible abyss! (looks at the Sea Monster)

Sea Monster: Hey! Who are you calling dark and depressing?

SpongeBob: We didn't mean it that way, Mr. Sea Monster, sir! What we really want to know is... are you hungry?

Sea Monster: Hungry? I've been asleep for 79 years. Which means my final meal was 79 years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.

SpongeBob: Then try one of our Krabby Patties.

Sea Monster: Mmm! That's the best thing I've tasted since that sewer spill...back in '76. I'll take 640 of them.

SpongeBob and Patrick: Woo hoo!

Patrick: Order...uh...up. (the Sea Monster gives them large wads of cash)

Plankton: Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. (looks at the Sea Monster paying them) This calls for drastic, uh.. rish... measures! Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!

Patrick: SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?

SpongeBob: No!

Patrick: Neither do I!

Plankton: Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the...(the vehicle crashes into a cavern wall) Ah, who needs that Rust Bucket anyhow. (Takes out a parachute)

Sea Monster: Come on in there! I want more sandwiches!

Patrick: (a piece of chum enters) SpongeBob, look!

SpongeBob: What is it?

Patrick: It's a liquid.

SpongeBob: No, it's a solid! It's a solid!

SpongeBob and Patrick: It's a "lol-squid."

Sea Monster: All right, what's going on in there? Hey, that looks like a sandwich to me!

SpongeBob: But not just a sandwich. It's a...Chumwich.

Sea Monster: (eats it) Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!

(cut to a sequence of SpongeBob making Chumwiches, Patrick collecting the Chum, and the Sea Monster paying them for the Chumwiches)

SpongeBob: Anything else before we shove off?

Sea Monster: I want dessert!

SpongeBob: We don't have desserts.

Plankton: (lands from his parachute) Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my...(falls down and rolls into some mud)

Sea Monster: Hey, a chocolate eclair! Now that looks like dessert to me!

Plankton: No! No, no, no, no! You've got it all wrong, see... Hey! (the Sea Monster chases Plankton)

(cut to the Krusty Krab)

Janitor: (repairing the windows SpongeBob and Patrick broke previously) There you are, Mr. Krabs, just like new again.

Squidward: Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the...(the submarine crashes into the windows. Janitor looks disappointedly at the window)

SpongeBob: We're back, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: Tell me all about it. Please, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!

SpongeBob: You wouldn't believe it, we had so many new customers!

Mr. Krabs: I don't really care about that. Tell me about the money.

SpongeBob: There we were at the bottom of a deep, dark, abyss. And we had to let go of something heavy.

Patrick: And paper.

Mr. Krabs: You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?

SpongeBob: (he and Patrick nod their heads) But on the bright side, we did manage to bring back 37,000 pounds of these decorative deep sea rocks!


(The episode starts at the mall, where SpongeBob and Patrick are trying on shirts.)

Patrick: Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob? (giggles)

SpongeBob: Well, according to this shirt, it says my best friend is right here. (tickles Patrick, making him laugh.)

Patrick: (jumps to the other side of him) How about now?

SpongeBob: (flips upside down with the arrow pointing to Patrick) Right by my side. (both laugh) Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other. (sniffs) Let's get 'em, Patrick.

Female Fish: Can I help you boys?

SpongeBob: I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...(Patrick starts crying) Patrick, why are you crying?

Patrick: You found a new best friend.

SpongeBob: Oh, what are you... (sees his shirt point to the female fish next to him) Ahhhhh!!!! Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like! (Patrick keeps crying)

SpongeBob: Patrick, look out, behind you!!

Female fish #2: Excuse me, but this is coming...

Patrick: No!!!! You're not my best friend!!!

SpongeBob: We've got to ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals! (They tear off their shirts and stomp on them; they soon get kicked out of the mall)

SpongeBob: We need new clothes to show our best "friendliness", Pat.

Patrick: You mean like those guys? (points to fish dressed up in red and blue uniforms)

SpongeBob: Yeah, just like those guys. (walk in the fields, sighs) Best friend outfits like these really make a statement.

Patrick: Look at these guys.

SpongeBob: Whoa! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?

Fish in Red uniform: Oh, no, these aren't my friends. In fact, I hate just about everyone here, but my love for historic battles is so great I join these losers every year to re-enact the battle of Bikini Bottom.

SpongeBob: There was a battle of Bikini Bottom? (Patrick and fish gasp in shock)

Patrick: Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups. (shows flashback of a fish washing his hands) Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies. (shows fish's clean hands)

Blue Fish: Clean as a whistle!

Patrick: And those who had more important things to do with their time. (a Colonial version of Patrick comes out of a bathroom with filthy hands)

Colonial Patrick: Well, looks good to me.

Blue Fish: That is truly disgusting!

Patrick: Oh, yeah?

Blue Fish: You can't go around our town touching things with those filthy mitts!

Colonial Patrick: Oh, yeah?!

Blue Fish: Yes! (Patrick slaps him with a glove and they begin fighting; a battleground is shown, with one cannon being filled with filth, and the other with soap bars)

Red Group: Wash your hands!!!

Blue Group: Never!!! (the battle begins with the groups firing at each other) (End flashback)

Patrick: And that's how we won our right to wash as we please. (he shows his filthy hands)

Fish in Red: (disgusted) That's not what happened. (walks away)

SpongeBob: (looking disturbed) You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!

Patrick: Never have, never will.

SpongeBob: Blech!!

Patrick: Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob? (flashbacks)

Patrick: They only had one ice cream cone. (has scoop of ice cream in hand)

SpongeBob: That's ok. Thank you, friend. (licks it off Patrick's hand)

(another flashback, with them eating at a restaurant)

SpongeBob: (swallows food) So, anyway, and then I said...

Patrick: (interrupts) Wait. You got something on your tongue.

SpongeBob: Really? Patrick: Here, I'll get it. (grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes a piece of meat off it)

SpongeBob: Thank you. (end flashback)Frankly, yes, Patrick, it does bother me.

Patrick: Well, then I guess we can't be friends.

SpongeBob: What are you saying?

Patrick: (grunts) Do I have to spell it out for you? (Licks his hand and writes on a brick wall) Um... How do you spell "not my friend"?

SpongeBob: Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.(sprays all around him, making a spray house) Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you. (takes off Patrick's coat, which reveals filth on his body)

Patrick: No, thank you. (Takes back his coat) I happen to like my various smells and germs.

SpongeBob: But being clean is so much better.

Patrick: Well, says you. I like dirty.

SpongeBob: Clean!

Patrick: Dirty!

SpongeBob: Clean!

Fish in blue uniform: Uh, excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact.

SpongeBob: Fine, if that's how is, then (tears off fish's red outfit) I am joining the other side!

Patrick: (tears off fish's blue outfit) Fine, me too!

Fish: Oh, come on! Let's go play somewhere else.

(cuts to Patrick looking through binoculars; SpongeBob sneaks up on him and gets his "nose")

SpongeBob: Hah! Got your nose!

Patrick: Hey, give it back!

SpongeBob: Not until you wash your hands!

Patrick: Oh yeah, well (takes SpongeBob's eyes) I got your eyeballs!(runs with them, but sees that they are bombs, which squirt water out)SpongeBob:(gets eyeballs back and laughs)

(Patrick launches his brain at SpongeBob like a cannon and hits SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: (screams) Ew, brain juice!

Patrick: (puts brain back in his head) Do you give up yet?

SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick (wipes himself off), but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me.

Patrick: Your pants are falling down.

SpongeBob: Really?

Patrick: I'll fix it. (Takes dirt and puts it in SpongeBob's pants, then yanks his underwear, making SpongeBob squish up with dirt.)

SpongeBob: Satisfied?

Patrick: There, you look good now.

SpongeBob: You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet.

Patrick: Why, what's wrong with them? (shows a closeup of his filthy foot)

SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll take care of it.(Attacks Patrick and starts doing a pedicure on his feet)

Patrick: No! Not a pedicure!! Ahhh!!! No, no, not that, anything but that--ahh! Nail Polish! (shows his feet look better) You sick little monster, face my morning breath!!!

(Patrick inhales and then exhales fowl breath, making SpongeBob break.)

SpongeBob: You, sir, could use some dental hygiene?

Patrick: Who, me? My teeth are fine, see?(shows a closeup of his nasty teeth)

SpongeBob: A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.(shows a closeup of his nice-looking teeth)

(Patrick screams and runs away, with SpongeBob jumping on him and brushes his teeth)

SpongeBob: You got to brush in little circles!(laughs)

Patrick: (throws him off) Minty fresh! Taste pit, evil-doer!!(Patrick's armpit hairs fly out and rub SpongeBob on Patrick's armpit, getting SpongeBob's face very filthy)

SpongeBob: You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of this!!(shows deodorant spray)

Patrick: No, no...not deodorant.(SpongeBob sprays the can and Patrick runs away, but the spray kills his hairs and the smell.)

Patrick: My beautiful pit-stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now. (Takes his hand off to show a human hand) It's booger time!

SpongeBob: Oh, booger, smooger, you don't even have a nose.

Patrick: Oh, yeah?(He clenches his face, and forms a nose. SpongeBob gasps, and Patrick picks his nose.)

SpongeBob: Ahhh, booger!!! Ahhhhh!!! Run! (runs to the Krusty Krab, with Patrick behind him) Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!( they run into the kitchen)

Mr. Krabs: Gold? (laughs. He runs to find the gold, but comes out with nothing.)

Squidward: Did you get any of Patrick's "gold"?

Mr. Krabs: He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.

(cuts to the kitchen)

Patrick: Ah-ha! I've got you now!

SpongeBob: (looks around and sees a knife and 2 onions) Careful, Patrick, I've got a weapon!( throws 2 onions at Patrick's eyes)

Patrick: Ugh!! Raw onions!!(starts crying) That does it!!(picks up a Krabby Patty) See this?

SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty? What are you gotta do, eat it?

Patrick: Oh, I'm not going to eat it.( pulls it apart and puts the Krabby Patty on his feet)

SpongeBob: No, not patty socks!!

Patrick: That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet!(starts stomping around)

SpongeBob: You better stop that!

Patrick: (laughs) Stinky, little feet.(stomps and hops around)

SpongeBob: ( getting angry) Ooh, you stop that right now!!!!(He turns red and inflates angrily)

Patrick: Hoppin'...(SpongeBob blows up and sends Patrick flying)..crabs!!!( he lands in a dumpster and gets out) Hey, I got my filth back!

SpongeBob: Not for long, Mr. StinkyShorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you!(shows a soap bar and eats it.)

Patrick: (terrified) No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!

SpongeBob: Try me!

Patrick: (lifts up the dumpster) Stay back, I'll do it!

SpongeBob: It's too late for that!( SpongeBob starts shooting soap bubbles out of his craters, while Patrick throws the dumpster at SpongeBob. The bubbles hit Patrick, and SpongeBob laughs in victory, only to have the dumpster fall on him.)

Patrick: (now clean) My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!!

SpongeBob: (climbs out of dumpster and is quite filthy) I'm covered in muck and scum!!

Patrick: Man! To get my filth back, I’ll have to wallow in mud forever!

SpongeBob: It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need 20 baths a day!

Patrick: Slather toe jam on my armpits!

SpongeBob: I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!

Patrick: Smear slime on my teeth!

SpongeBob: And dry-clean my uvula!

(they think for a minute and then they giggle happily)

Both: All right!

SpongeBob: Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean.

Patrick: And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob!(shakes hands)

SpongeBob: No, Patrick, thank you.

Both (they hug): You're my best friend ever!!

Fish in uniform: Hey, what's going on here? This battle isn't over until we have a winner.

SpongeBob: (philosophically) Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?

Patrick: Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky. (rubs himself everywhere, making a squeaky sound)

SpongeBob: (nods) Mm-hm, he has embraced the truth.

Fish in red uniform: Wow! I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson.

SpongeBob: And what is that, my son?

Fish in red uniform: That re-enacting battles is really lame! (talks to other fish) C'mon, guys, let's go do something more manly, like football!

Fish #2: Or hockey!

Fish #3: Or knitting fluffy sweaters! Yeah!

(fish pause, and then run off)

SpongeBob: Come, Patrick, my work here is done. (walks off into the sunset, with Patrick still rubbing his body)
SpongeBob: (frantically jumps out of bed) Good morning, Gary! Good morning, Mister Mailman!

Mailman: Morning, SpongeBob. Ah, it is a good morning, isn't it. (The Mailman crashes into a truck on his bicycle and flies across the sky) AAAHHH!

SpongeBob: Isn't life great, Gary? Oh, what a beautiful day. I have the best friends...

Squidward: Ah, stay away! Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare.

SpongeBob: The best job...

Mr. Krabs: He's already 10 seconds late. I'm doubting he's not paying for this.

SpongeBob: And, of course, the bestest pet.

Gary: Meow. (SpongeBob squeezes Gary in a hug, which causes Gary's shell to break. SpongeBob runs out of his house)

SpongeBob: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! (runs into Patrick)

Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: Hey Patrick! How goes it?

Patrick: Well, it was great until you showed up. (turns around and shows a cake splattered on his belly)

SpongeBob: What's that?

Patrick: Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all night baking. And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to bake a second birthday cake that'll make my mother a day late! Retard Boy!

SpongeBob: Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company. (SpongeBob goes to the door of Squidward's house)

SpongeBob: Squidward!

Squidward: Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Retard Boy! (Cut to the Treedome, where Sandy has invented a robot)

Sandy: It's all done! My greatest invention yet! (the robot starts to dance)

SpongeBob: Sandy! What a neat robot! (SpongeBob trips on a log. Some of the water from his helmet goes onto Sandy's robot)

Sandy: No!! (Sandy's robot blows up)

SpongeBob: Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise.

Sandy: Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. look at the surprise I got! (she shows the destroyed robot) Get out of here! Retard Boy!

SpongeBob: I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not! (Cut to the Krusty Krab) SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs.

Mr. Krabs: Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.

SpongeBob: No worries, captain! (SpongeBob trips on some frying pans) Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up... (SpongeBob slides on a puddle of water and starts screaming)

Mr. Krabs: (playing with his dollars, laughing) Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar. (hears SpongeBob's screaming) What the barnacles is going on?

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! (SpongeBob slides and hits Mr Krabs. Mr. Krabs falls in the fryer and gets out immediately) Mr. Krabs, are you OK?

Mr. Krabs: I'm fine, as long as me money's OK. (SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs notice both dollars in the fryer)

Mr. Dollar: (to Mrs. Dollar) Although we know each other a short time, I want you to know... I love you. (both dollars disintegrate as they cry. SpongeBob laughs nervously)

Mr. Krabs: (kicks out SpongeBob) If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- RETARD BOY!!!! (SpongeBob is shocked and alarmed)

SpongeBob: I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me "Retard Boy", it must be true. I know what must be done! (SpongeBob starts crying, his tears creating a river that leads him to his house) I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gary?

(We see Gary putting a bandage on his back. He hisses at SpongeBob)

SpongeBob: (sighs) I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you. (walks out of his house and turns around) Goodbye, pineapple. (the chimney blows SpongeBob up in the sky) Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it. (he lands on the road next to the sign) Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538. (crosses out the "8" with a chalk and puts a "7" next to it) Minus 1. (he leaves Bikini Bottom down the road) Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy, Idiot Boy... (that night, SpongeBob is scared by a bunch of very weird people. He runs for his life, but falls off the cliff upside down, causing him to boink his head on a bunch of rocks until he reaches the bottom of the cliff. Now he's got a long bump on his head) Oooh, boy, that's quite a lump. I better not hit my head again. That might cause a concession. (the things that SpongeBob packed hit him on the head, causing him to faint. Cut to Patrick, who is knocking on SpongeBob's door and drinking a milkshake)

Sandy: Patrick, where's SpongeBob?

Patrick: I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake. (drinks his milkshake)

Sandy: We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah! (brushes through the door)

Gary: Mrloooow.

Sandy: Gary? Where are you, little guy? (searches for Gary)

Gary: Mrloooow.

Sandy: Gary? Gary? (bumps on some of Gary's snail slime on his bottom. Cut to see that Gary is now extremely huge and overweight)

Gary: Mrloow.

Sandy: Gary! What happened to you?

Gary: Mrlooooooowrooowroowrooow. (Sandy sees a note on Gary's food bowl)

Sandy: A note. (picks up the note and reads it) To whom it may concern: if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Retard Boy. (Patrick and Sandy look at each other sadly. Cut to SpongeBob, who wakes up when he hears villagers)

Villager Man: I could use this.

Villager Woman: Yeah, I like these here.

Villager Man: This is top quality.

SpongeBob: Hello there. (the villagers gasp) What's going on?

Villager Man: Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you... SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: (looks behind, then turns around to the villagers) Are you talking to me?

Villager Man: Isn't this your name? (shows SpongeBob's nametag)

SpongeBob: I don't know, is it?

Villager Man: You don't know your name?

SpongeBob: All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything. (the villagers wink at each other)

Villager Man: Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm... it's... CheeseHead BrownPants. Ha ha! That's it!

SpongeBob: CheeseHead, huh? (checks his pockets) Wait a minute, what's this? (shows a bubble bottle)

Villager Man: Bubbles?!

(The villagers scream and run away)

SpongeBob: I wonder what got into them? (Sees the town called "New Kelp City". Cut to a "BREAKING NEWS" slide)

Perch Perkins: We interrupt this program for an important announcement. (cut to Perch Perkins in Bikini Bottom, where a crowd of people are panicking) Bikini Bottom is literally in a state of total chaos tonight. (a muscular guy pushes Perch)

Muscular Guy: (yelling on screen) Literally!! (runs off)

Perch Perkins: (gets up weakly with a black eye) We go now to news scene chopper 7. What's up?

News Chopper: (we see someone flying in a helicopter) Not looking too good out here, Perch. The Krusty Krab is about to come apart of the henges. Customers are in a rage over not getting their Krabby Patties.

Mr. Krabs: (running to Squidward) Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!

Squidward: If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?

Mr. Krabs: Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...

(Both start arguing. Sandy comes in)

Sandy: Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?

Squidward: I think we just went through this...

Mr. Krabs: What he means to say is, no, we haven't.

Sandy: Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back. (hands Mr. Krabs the note)

Mr. Krabs: Let me see that. (begins to read) To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means (muttering...) sincerely... AKA? AKA? Retard Boy? RETARD BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?

Patrick: What am I gonna do without my best friend? I should never have been mean to you! (starts to cry)

Sandy: I should have never kicked you out of my house! (starts to cry. Her helmet fills up with tears)

Squidward: (sadly) If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob-- (happily) I would have slammed the door in his face even harder! (starts laughing. Everyone except Squidward and Mr. Krabs is very sad. Mr. Krabs pushes the customers out of the Krusty Krab)

Mr. Krabs: All right, all right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice! (closes the doors) Now... (he and the others gather around) how do you propose we find me money-making employee?

(Cut to SpongeBob in the streets of New Kelp City)

SpongeBob: Whoo, I live in a dump! (bumps into a green fish)

Fish: Hey, watch where your stepping!

SpongeBob: Sorry, sir, I was just-

Fish: I know what you was doing. You was doing the old "bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change" routine, but it ain't gonna work this time. You want money? Get a job, you deadbeat!

SpongeBob: I'm a jobless deadbeat? What a sad existence I don't remember I live. (fade to black. Cut back to SpongeBob. His tummy is grumbling) Ooh, seems like I'm running on empty. (checks his pockets and sighs) Not a penny to my name. Well, I guess if I want to fill the hole in my gut, I'll need to fill a job somewhere. (checks a bank sign that says "Help Wanted") Help wanted?

Help Wanted Lady: Well, Mr.... BrownPants... you seem to have left this entire application blank.

SpongeBob: (laughs) I can't remember a thing.

Help Wanted Lady: Well, do you have any special skills?

SpongeBob: Special skills... oh, I can do this! (blows a bubble)

Help Wanted Lady: (screams) Oh, what do you think you're doing?! (kicks out SpongeBob) Sorry, sir, but we run a respectable business here! (she slams the door)

SpongeBob: Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand. (SpongeBob is hired as a builder) Thanks for the job, boss! You won't be disappointed.

Builder: That's real sweet, BrownPants, but I don't hear that hammer pounding.

SpongeBob: (pounding the hammer while flying on a bubble) Then this might be music to your ears.

Builder: (sees the bubble) Neptune's son, what are you doing? (gets down from the building) You aren't doing that on my building site! You're fired! (the bubble pops and SpongeBob falls down)

SpongeBob: I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me. (looks at a man from All That Glitters) Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me? (shows a gruesome look on his face. The man screams and runs away. Cut to the Krusty Krab)

Sandy: Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob.

Mr. Krabs: You do?

Sandy: Yup, and it involves this. (shows a device) It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius.

Squidward: So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?

Sandy: You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find-- (Squidward smashes the device with a hammer.)

Squidward: Oops, I dropped it. (Mr. Krabs is enraged. His nose rises and blows up like a balloon, then bursts.)

Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!!! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape. And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!

Squidward: (laughs) I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.

Mr. Krabs: If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.

Squidward: Ha! Is that your version of a threat?

Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.

Squidward: Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any- (gasps) Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!

Mr. Krabs: Not so fast! (pushes Squidward) Bring back me number one fry cook first.

(Cut to SpongeBob, who is cold in the streets of New Kelp City. He goes to get warm near a fire)

Fish: Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?

SpongeBob: Yeah.

Other Fish: Heh, not for us... we're just waiting in line for a new video game.

SpongeBob: I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat. (sighs) You guys mind if I bubble?

Fish: (frightened) You can't do that here!!

SpongeBob: But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch. (blows a bubble) See? Feeling better already.

(everyone who sees the bubble screams and runs away.)

SpongeBob: What could possibly be wrong with practicing the bubble arts? Seems like a harmless activity. (laughs)

(SpongeBob gets ready to blow another bubble, when he is approached by a gang who are snapping their fingers. They grab SpongeBob)

Bubble Poppin' Boy: Do you have any... (the others continue snapping) I think we've made our point with the snapping! (They stop snapping) As I was saying... do you have any idea who we are?

SpongeBob: Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um...

Bubble Poppin' Boy: Don't answer. (laughs) I'll show ya. (turns around to show the back of his shirt, which says "Bubble Poppin' Boys") We call us the Bubble Poppin' Boys. And article 1 of our charter prohibits bubble blowing on our turf. (pops the bubble. Its water gets in his eyes and he gets angry, showing his red eyes) You see why we don't allow bubbles in our city? Fortunately, we have ways of dealing with careless bubble blowers like you. Let's rough him up, boys! (the gang is ready to beat SpongeBob, but he runs away)

Bubble Poppin' Boy: Where'd he go? (sees SpongeBob run) After him!!

(SpongeBob tries to hide from the Bubble Poppin' Boys, but they surround him. SpongeBob blows four bubbles to make a stairway. One of the Bubble Poppin' Boys climbs up a street light. SpongeBob then blows a bubble raft and hops on it)

SpongeBob: Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort. (The Bubble Poppin' Boys try to shoot down the bubble raft with slingshots. SpongeBob blows a bubble paddle and paddles away, but one of the slingshots pop the bubble raft and paddle, causing SpongeBob to fall. SpongeBob lands on the street safely, but the bottle of bubble soap spills, and the bubble wand falls in the sewer. The Bubble Poppin' Boys are running towards SpongeBob, but he sticks his hand into the spilled bubble soap and blows a big bubble to trap the Bubble Poppin' Boys, causing them to float up and out of New Kelp City)

Man: You- you did it! (grunts and runs over to SpongeBob) Do you realize what you've done?

SpongeBob: No.

Man: You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town! (All of the citizens of New Kelp City come out and blow bubbles)

All: Thank you, CheeseBoy!

Man #2: What an amazing gift CheeseBoy has given us.

SpongeBob: Actually, it's CheeseHead. (a car appears. Its horn honks as a window rolls down, and the mayor of New Kelp City appears)

Mayor: Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City. You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets. (laughs) Something I wasn't able to do for 20 years as mayor. For this, I appoint you... (puts his hat on SpongeBob's head) mayor of New Kelp City!

All: (lifting up SpongeBob) All hail mayor CheeseHead!! (SpongeBob smiles. Cut to Patrick, Sandy and Squidward, who are still searching for SpongeBob)

Sandy: SpongeBob!

Patrick: SpongeBob!

Sandy: SpongeBob!

Patrick: (lifts up the road) Buddy? You there? (puts the road down)

Sandy: SpongeBob! (points at the truck stop) Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy.

Patrick: SpongeBob! (they walk to the truck stop)

Sandy: There he is, guys!

Patrick: Huh? SpongeBob! (laughs and runs into Evelyn) Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.

Sandy: That's not SpongeBob, Patrick. There's SpongeBob. (Patrick drops Evelyn. She points to the newspaper carrier)

Patrick: (yells) I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy! (breaks the glass with a brick and hugs the newspaper) You're safe now in my arms. (notices that the picture of SpongeBob on the newspaper is gone) Huh? Where'd you go now? (cries)

Sandy: Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly.

Patrick: Oh.

Sandy: Now let's see what that little critter's up to. (reads) New mayor of... (gasps) SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!

SpongeBob: Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets, but I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of new kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants.

Sandy: CheeseHead BrownPants?

SpongeBob: New Kelp City has brown-pants mania.

Sandy: Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here but Bikini Bottom needs you back, Spongebob.

SpongeBob: What's that?

Patrick: Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy.

SpongeBob: Oh, this is a surprise.

Sandy: Surprised I found you?

SpongeBob: No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.

Sandy: It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob.

SpongeBob: Sandy. But I'd probably remember an underwater, talking weasel.

Sandy: You may not remember the weasel but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you?

SpongeBob: I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor.

Sandy: You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back.

SpongeBob: Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership.

Sandy: Spongebob, wait! Don't just stand there, get in. Squidward?

Squidward: Hurry up! (the trio enter the limo) Decorative egg, here I come. (limo is leaving New Kelp City, then reaches the Krusty Krab) Here it is.

Sandy: You must recognize this place.

SpongeBob: Nope.

Mr. Krabs: Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties.

SpongeBob: I was a fry cook before?

Mr. Krabs: Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping.

SpongeBob: Look, guys, as much as I'd love to toil the days away flipping burgers I think I'll just go back to my modest job as mayor of a major city.

Squidward: Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time! Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook you gotta pay up.

Mr. Krabs: All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.

(Squidward trips the egg onto spilt grease stuck with the spatula and crashes into SpongeBob's head. A bump rises onto his head)

Sandy: You ok, SpongeBob?

SpongeBob: Yeah, just a bit of a headache, sandy. Hey, I remember this place.

Sandy: SpongeBob's back!

Mr. Krabs: We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back.

SpongeBob: I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Good-bye, everyone.

Mr. Krabs: Huh? What? Oh, not again.

Squidward: He's leaving again!

Perch Perkins: Stop what you're doing and don't go out that door. This is a KNKC special report. (Shows BBN logo) Panic in the streets of New Kelp City as rampant bubbles bring visibility down to 0. The angry citizens here blame the apocalyptic scene on Mayor CheeseHead BrownPants and his newly-enacted bubble policy. (another muscular fish pushes him on the screen)

Construction Fish: If I ever see Mayor Brown Pants again I'm gonna grab his little, yellow neck and literally rip his throat out! (screen changes to "We Are Experiencing Technical Difficulties. Thank You for watching this Channel.")

Mr. Krabs: Where's SpongeBob?

(SpongeBob is in the Krusty Krab kitchen)

SpongeBob: (rings a bell) Order up! (hands a Krabby Patty on plate)

Mr. Krabs: Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town?

SpongeBob: And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend?

Patrick: Krabby Patty! SpongeBob, another masterpiece.

Sandy: It's great to have you back, Spongey.

SpongeBob: Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.

(Background cow mooing plays. Squidward's eyes twitch, he takes out a revolver loads it, and shoots himself in the head.)

Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Where it's almost as if the evolutionary clock ticks backwards.

(Music continues)

Squidward: Hold on a second.

Squidward: Do you mind, I'm trying to work in a fast food restaurant. You might want to try it sometime! 
SpongeBob: I sure would, Squidward. That sounds... (Patrick interferes)
Patrick: Oh, wait a minute! SpongeBob, you already do work in a fast food restaurant! 
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Squidward: Remind me to fire my therapist. (shows the costumers) And stop bringing your neighbors to work!
Patrick: We're not just neighbors.
SpongeBob: You can say that again!
Patrick: We're not just... (Squidward interferes)
Squidward: I don't care! (faces the customers, embarrassed. Laughs nervously) 419, please.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!
Squidward: (Squidward is shown like a thermometer, reaching the boiling point) Alright! I am gonna... Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but... (SpongeBob opens the door and bashes Squidward's face)
SpongeBob: (singing) She'll be comin' around the Krabby Patty when she comes!
Squidward: Ahh! (SpongeBob looks into Squidward) SpongeBob, you nincompoop! You broke my face! Don't just stand there, help me! I need a doctor!
(Sounds of operation, SpongeBob eats Krusty Krab hats, Dr. Gill Gilliam opens the door)
SpongeBob: (gasps) Oh, doctor! Is he gonna be alright? For the love of Neptune, tell me!
Dr. Gill Gilliam: Well son...
SpongeBob: No! don't tell me! I can't take it!(SpongeBob is crying)
Dr. Gill Gilliam: We should know...
SpongeBob: No, please. Just... just don't.
Dr. Gill Gilliam: We won't know for two weeks. You'll just have to wait. (Dr. Gill Gilliam leaves)
SpongeBob: Two weeks? I'll never make it. (SpongeBob falls down)
(Two weeks later, SpongeBob comes into the hospital with a bouquet of flowers)
Nurse: Mornin' SpongeBob. You're early today.
SpongeBob: Good morning Nurse Rechid. (walks over to an old lady) Hi, Mabel. Saved the blue one just for you. (takes out a blue flower and gives it to Mabel)
Mabel: Oh, SpongeBob. Blue is my favorite color. Er... or is it orange?
SpongeBob: (laughs) Don't worry, Mabel. I'm sure your amnesia'll wear off in no time. (walks away)
Mabel: My what?
SpongeBob: (flops into Squidward's room) Hiya Squidward! I've been practicing how to flop on my back.
Squidward: (muffled shouting. His head is covered with bandages.)
Dr. Gill Gilliam: We can't really have you in here today. I'm going to be removing Squidward's bandages and he made me swear to keep you far away from him.
SpongeBob: It has been two weeks already? (SpongeBob Smiling). Don't worry doc. I promise to stay out of the way.
Dr. Gill Gilliam: Okay. As long as you stay on the other side of the... (sighs) Right. (takes out some scissors and is about to remove the bandages on Squidward's face)
SpongeBob: Don't rush it! Sorry, go ahead. Wait!
Dr. Gill Gilliam: (angrily) What is it?
SpongeBob: Are you sure that the patient has enough emensmansera?
Dr. Gill Gilliam: I have no idea what that is. Please. Just let me work.
SpongeBob: Very well, doctor. Carry on.
Dr. Gill Gilliam: May I?
SpongeBob: Hold it! The readings on this brain meter are all wrong! We must postpone the operation!
Dr. Gill Gilliam: That is a television set put here for the patient's enjoyment. It is not even plugged into the wall!
SpongeBob: You're right, doctor. Proceed with operation sever. Hold it!
Dr. Gill Gilliam: Now what?!
(On the television)
Nurse: Doctor, we can't do this. Surely we can use a less dangerous procedure. After all, we have to start thinking about... the welfare! (Dr. Gill Gilliam turns off the TV)
SpongeBob: Wait!
Dr: Gill Gilliam: What could it possibly be this time?!
SpongeBob: I just want to say sorry for interrupting you before.
Dr. Gill Gilliam: (gasps) I...I...I can't believe it. (Dr. Gill Gilliam faints)
Squidward: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Squidward: How does it look?
SpongeBob: Great Neptune...
Squidward: Come on. Spit it out. I can take it.
Nurse: Time for your medicine, Mister...Mister...Mister...Handsome! Ohhh... (The nurse melts)
Squidward: What did she call me?
SpongeBob: Handsome. But she spelled it wrong.
Squidward: Quick hand me that mirror. What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I am handsome!
SpongeBob: Squidward, you're not handsome. You're a hunk!
(People then started to notice Squidward)
Female Fish #1: So handsome! (faints)
Male Fish #1: Handsome! (Then more people faint)
Male Fish #2: (Crash!) Hello, Handsome.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward. People really seem to be noticing how handsome you are now. You might even be more handsome than before.
Female Fish #1: Ahhhh!! So handsome!
SpongeBob: If that's even possible.
Old lady in a wheel chair: Uh...Ahhh! It's a miracle...I can walk.
Blind Man: I can see!
Fat Student Fish: I can fly! (starts to fly) Uh-oh. My shoe's untied. (his shoe falls).
Female Teen Fish: Mr. Handsome, can I have your autograph? No! not in the book, on my retainer.
SpongeBob and Squidward: A limousine?! (shocked then the crowd cheers).
Squidward: Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery. (Limo stops at Squidward's house while the crowd cheers for them).
SpongeBob: Now I'm gonna clip my toenails Squidward, don't forget to enjoy being handsome.
Squidward: Oh, don't worry.
Crowd: (cheers) Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! Handsome! (night time and crowd still keeps on cheering for Squidward until dawn).
Squidward: Huh? Well, better go greet the commoners.
Crowd: Handsome! Handsome! Handsome!
Squidward: Good morning my people! Sorry to have kept you waiting, but even I (laughs) stranger to seen, need my beauty sleep.
Male Fish #3: I want his shirt!
Male Fish #4: I want his eyelids! (crowd rips his shirt)
Squidward: I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger (plays the clarinet).
Male Fish #5: Hey what is that sound?
Male Fish #6: Wait it's him! The handsome man! (crowd cheers).
Squidward: Beautiful and talented. what more do they want? Don't worry folks, there's more where that came from...Hey! (a guy stole his clarinet)

Male Fish: #?: I got the clarinet! (crowd rips the shirt of the fish who got Squidward's clarinet and breaks his clarinet).
Squidward: (smells the liquid soap) There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure. Hey my grandmother gave me that soap! Well no one ever said it'll be easy being so handsome Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to be..ahh! (a big female fish with 4 eyes pop out of his bath tub)
Big Female Fish: Hi, Handsome.
Male Fish #7: Handsome!
Female Fish #8: Handsome!
Female Fish #9: Handsome! Let's get him!
Squidward: Ahh!!! (jumps out of the window). SpongeBob! You gotta help me! They stole my bubble bath! Public life ain't all it's cracked up to be. I want my own life back.
SpongeBob: Hmmm... I know just what to do. (crowed chases Squidward and SpongeBob)
Mr. Krabs: Squidward? What have you done? You know how much the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me.

(SpongeBob stone plays foul notes)

SpongeBob: Is there something wrong?

(Jellyfish sting SpongeBob. SpongeBob runs back to cave, whimpering.)

SpongeBob: Hmmmmm. I crafted one stone SpongeBob that provided a note in a foul key. But if I crafted another,(pulls down extremely complicated equation on a blackboard) the dimension of the hollow center multiplied by the number of holes, may offer another tune. One that could soothe those jellyfish. But which one is the right size?! Hmm. I'll just have to make a bunch of them.

(SpongeBob makes the eight musical stones)

SpongeBob: All right. That oughta do her.
