(At the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is cooking Krabby Patties, and hears them sizzle. A big puff of steam comes up. SpongeBob sniffs it in, exhales it in the shape of a heart, then kisses it. He sighs.)

SpongeBob: I know I've said this 90 times already but... (voice goes up)
I love Krabby Patties,
I think that they are swell.
They are the best,
There's no contest,
And now I'm going to yell. 
SpongeBob: Whew! (SpongeBob fills his holes up with air while Squidward walks to the soda machine with a box of cups, and makes a replica of a house of cards with cups. SpongeBob then becomes like a circle, then exhales, which causes the music to continue.)
I love Krabby Patties!
I think they're swell.
They're so neat,
and quite a treat,
And, oh, I love the way they smell...
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Squidward: (the house of cards falls down) I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed today.
SpongeBob: La la la la laaaaaaa...la la la la!!!
(a tour bus comes out with Ms. Priss dusting the ground, coming out, and blowing a whistle that signals more ladies that are similar to her. Mr. Krabs is at the door wearing a viking helmet for some reason)

Mr. Krabs: Hello, and welcome one and all your money to ye old Krusty Krabby!
Ms. Priss: Come along, sisters. Pay not mind to this CRIMSON ABOMINATION!!
(Priss walks into restaurant with sisters in single file behind her, stopping at the register and Squidward, who is reading a "Gossip" Magazine)

Squidward: (Notices Priss) Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Ms. Priss: Greetings. Although your establishment seems repugnant and foul in nature, it seems not to offend our sensitivities. It is for that reason, plus the fact that we have been stuck on a tour bus for several days, that my sisters and I would like to EAT something here.
Squidward: Okay. But first let me call the mortician and tell him his uniform's been stolen. (Squidward cracks up) Clothing zinger!
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! These wretched hags-I mean, these little lovely ladies-are obviously here to eat. So let's sell 'em- uh, I mean, serve them some delicious Krabby Patties!

Ms. Priss: Well, Mister...um...
Mr. Krabs: (Pulls eyes off like a top hat) Krabs, my lady. (Places them back) 
Ms. Priss: Mr. Krabs, you know the basic rules of behaving like a civilized bottom feeder. Perhaps your restaurant isn't quite the hive of degenerates it appears to be, and we had you figured all wrong.
Mr. Krabs: 'Course you did, as you're about to find out. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: (with tray of Krabby Patties and still singing "I Love Krabby Patties")

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...I like Krabby Patties!
I think they're swell. 
I like Krabby Patties,
And you cannot tell. 
Krabby Patties,
Krabby Patties. 
They're so neat. 
La la la la la. Sweet to eat. 
La la la la la. Really neat.
Really neat. 
Treat that's neat. 
Sweet, treat, treat, sweet, treat, sweet. 
Hickory, trick or treat.
(gibberish)
Ms. Priss: (blows her whistle, causing everyone to flinch and make SpongeBob fall on the floor, Patties and all) Look at this wild hooligan. Running amock, singing, dancing. It's... (Zooms in on Priss's face) It's shameless and disgusting. Avert your eyes. Young man, what has caused you to act like this? I must know!
SpongeBob: Actually, ma'am, (holds up a Krabby Patty) it was the absolute fun and deliciousness of a Krabby Patty.
Ms. Priss: Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Yeah, that's right.
Ms. Priss: Well, anything this fun and delicious can be good. Why, what would this world be if everyone cavorted it in such a manner?

Mr. Krabs: (Outraged) Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?

Ms. Priss: I am Ms. Grissle Puss. We are The United Organization Of Fish Against Things That Are Fun And Delicious. Or, TUOOFATAFAD for short. And we are going to BAN these so called "Krabby Patties", and CLOSE your restaurant forever!

Mr. Krabs: What the...! (SpongeBob cuts in)

SpongeBob: Ms. Grissle Puss, maybe if you were to taste the Krabby Patty for yourself, you two could experience the awesome pleasure.

Ms. Priss: I would soon sprout legs and do the Watusi!

SpongeBob: Ooh! Ok.

Mr. Krabs: Uh, it don't matter anyway, lad. (Mockingly) She can't close us down.

Narrator: Two Hours Later. (deleted version)

(cut to the Krusty Krab locked up and has a "Closed" sign on it)

Mr. Krabs: (Shouting) She closed us down! I'm ruined! How did it come to this? (cries)

Squidward: You called Ms. Priss a disgusting old prune and you threatened her with a french-fry strainer.

Mr. Krabs: Well, I didn't know her husband was the chief of police!

(Cut to behind SpongeBob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs, where Priss and 4 look-alikes stand in front of a muscular police officer going into a police car)

Ms. Priss: Thanks again, Al.

Al: Any time, honey. I'll see you at home for dinner. Mm! (licks his lips) I'm starving. (drives away) Yee-haw!

Ms. Priss: I just love that man.

(Cut back to Mr. Krabs tugging at the lock on the Krusty Krab teary-eyed, then to SpongeBob and Squidward sitting)

Squidward: How long has he been standing over there?

SpongeBob: (Looks at watch) Uh, 4 days.

(Mr. Krabs walks over)

Mr. Krabs: It's no use! (Raises claws, which become weird-like) I'M RUINED!!! (Cries and runs away)

SpongeBob: You know, it's too bad. The only way to make Krabby Patties again would be if you opened up a place that didn't look like a restaurant and did it secretly.

Mr. Krabs: (Comes right back) THAT'S IT! A SECRET KRUSTY KRAB! (Whispering) And I know just where to open it.

(Cut to SpongeBob's pineapple house, where Squidward is painting a banner that says "Grand Opening! The SECRET Krusty Krab!)

(Cut to inside the house. Mr. Krabs is dusting the cash register)

Mr. Krabs: There you are, Betsy! All good as new! (Kisses register as SpongeBob enters through door)

SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs-

Mr. Krabs: (Shocked) AH!!

SpongeBob: Whoa, sorry. I was just wondering-

Mr. Krabs: You know, lad, I can remember when people used to KNOCK before entering someone else's home!

SpongeBob: Yeah, but this is my home.

Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.

(Patrick walks in)

Patrick: Hey guys!

SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Thanks for helping out today!

Patrick: You bet! Where'd you want these extra buns? (Holds up an empty bag)

SpongeBob: (Points to bag) Patrick, that bag is totally empty.

(Patrick then lets out a big burp)

Patrick: Oops.

(Cut to a telescope sighting of the Krusty Krab sign, with a plank on it that says "Closed", then to Plankton with a small telescope in hand)

Plankton: Happy day, Karen! That fool Krabs changed the name of his restaurant to the CLOSED Krab! Everyone will think it's closed, and come eat here instead! He'll be ruined by tomorrow! Heh-heh, hat an idiot!

Karen: It is closed.

Plankton: What?

Karen: Ms. Priss and her husband banned Krabby Patties for being fun and delicious.

Plankton: Banned? Then that means, my day of reckoning has come at last! I 've WON, I tell you! I'VE WON!!! And what better way than by default. (Gets a tiny coat and tiny hat off a tiny rack)

Karen: Where are you going?

Plankton: Oh, out to celebrate. (Opens tiny automatic door and exits) Don't wait up for me! (Door closes)

(Cut to a line to the secret Krusty Krab)

Harold: (Gets pushed) Quit shoving.

Nat: I wasn't shoving. I was going like that and you happened to be standing there.

Harold: That's called shoving.

Nat: No, it isn't.

Harold: Yes, it is.

Nat: Nope.

Harold: Yes!

Nat: Nope! (Plankton arrives)

Plankton: Excuse me, gents! But what's with all the hullabaloo?

Harold: We're just waitin' in line to buy a Krabby Patty.

Plankton: Krabby Patty?! (He notices the secret restaurant and steam comes out of him)

Patrick: (Opens door to let out a customer) Thank you, come again! (Closes door, opens tiny hatch) Can I help whoever's next, please? (Plankton cuts to the front of the line with a ladder and climbs up to the hatch) What's the password, please?

Plankton: What are you talking about, you gargantuan buffoon?

Patrick: That's it! (Opens door) Come right in!

Plankton: Curse you! (Falls to the ground)

(Cut to the restaraunt area where people enjoy their Krabby Patties. Gary serves as a waiter here)

Gary: Meow.

Squidward: So, would you like to secret-size that for two dollars more?

Customer: Of course!

Mr. Krabs: Hey, "Squidwart"? You haven't seen any sign of... you know... (whispers) the cops! Have you?

Squidward: Did you just call me "Squidwart"?

Mr. Krabs: Okay, thanks. I'm gonna go see how SpongeBob's doing. (Goes to kitchen) Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? (SpongeBob is shuddering under his table) SpongeBob? What are you doing under the table?

SpongeBob: If Krabby Patties are illegal now, aren't we breaking the law?

Mr. Krabs: There's an old saying, lad. What doesn't kill ya...usually succeeds in the second attempt.

SpongeBob: But what does that have to do with making Krabby Patties?

Mr. Krabs: Nothing! But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!

SpongeBob: (runs from the table) NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Plankton: (spying on Mr. Krabs) So, Mr. Krabs is operating under the table, huh? Well, two can play at that game!

(cut to the phone in the library. A hook attached to a rope is thrown onto the phone and Plankton climbs onto it)

Plankton: (pants) Being a ruthless mastermind sure takes a lot out of you. (dials a phone number)

Al: Hello, this is officer Al, chief of police.

Plankton: Cops, I need you!

(cuts to police cars going towards the secret restaraunt. Miss Priss rides in Al's car)

Miss Priss: (points to restaraunt) There! (they arrive and people flee from them)

(cut to the entrance. There was a knock on the door)

Patrick: (opens hatch) What's the pas- (the police bust in and the door falls on Patrick) Nope, that's not it!

(people are screaming as the police invade the house. Plankton lifts up the bun from a Krabby Patty and laughs. Three fish flee the couch and a S.W.A.T. team member beats up the Krabby Patties. They also run over Gary, who is dizzy and retreats into his shell. They pack up Krabby Patties in huge bags)

Miss Priss: You missed one!

Mr. Krabs: Oh, Miss Grissle Puss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?

Miss Priss: Of course I do! You are a nuisance to my community!

Al: You tell him, honey! Ha! (eats a Krabby Patty) That's my girl!

Miss Priss: (gasp) Al! What are doing!?

Al: Having some lunch.

Miss Priss: Unhand that sandwich at once! (runs towards him)

SpongeBob: Miss Grissle Puss! Look out!

Miss Priss: What?

SpongeBob: Your shoe's untied!

Miss Priss: It is? (trips) Oh! (falls down on the ground. The Krabby Patty flies from Al's hand)

Al: (slow-motion) Oooooohhh... (in slow-motion, the Krabby Patty falls into Miss Priss's mouth. She chews and swallows it as Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and Al stare at her. She then opens her mouth)

Miss Priss: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!! (she turns happy and bursts into song)

I like Krabby Patties!
I think they're swell.
Can you not tell?
Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties,
they're so sweet!
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la laaaaaaaa!
(SpongeBob somehow imitated her voice)

SpongeBob: Really neat. (chuckles. They sing)

Miss Priss: Sweet to eat!

SpongeBob: Treat that's neat! (They utter gibberish)

Both: Aaaaaaannndddd... (they drop to the ground) dismount!

Miss Priss: That was wonderful! I..... I feel... reborn!

SpongeBob: Does that mean you're not sending us to the Slammer?

Miss Priss: Of course, my dear boy. I'm a kind, gentle fish. And I owe it all to you.

SpongeBob: Don't forget the spatula! (Mr. Krabs, Miss Priss, Al, and others laugh. Al goes towards Miss Priss)

Miss Priss: Don't push it, Al.

Plankton: (lifts bun from a Krabby Patty) Darn it! Ahh! Once again, so close and yet so far! When am I gonna- ooh! (He hides in the patty as Miss Priss picks it up)

Miss Priss: Well, I think I'll have another one. (bites it, revealing Plankton)

Plankton: Oh dear. YAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! (He screams as Miss Priss goes for a second bite. A "The End" card is shown and a gulp sound can be heard)

(Outside SpongeBob's house.)

SpongeBob: Hey, someone left a package! I wonder what's inside.

Stanley: Hello.

SpongeBob: Aah!

Stanley: It was awful there!

SpongeBob: Cousin Stanley!

Stanley: Cousin SpongeBob!

SpongeBob: So what brings you to Bikini Bottom, Stanley?
Stanley: Uncle Sherm sent me here to visit you. I have a note here somewhere. Oh, right. It's in here. (pulls the note out of his head) Here it is.

SpongeBob: (reading it) Dear, SpongeBob. I'm sending you cousin Stanley to live with you. He can't hold down a job and he ruins everything he touches. I can't take it anymore. Maybe you can straighten him out. Love, Uncle Sherm. Well, I guess its fine, Stanley.

Stanley: Wow! You have your own refrigerator. I never had one of these living with Uncle Sherm. (accidentally throws its contents) Whoa!

SpongeBob: Well, I guess I don't have to clean it anymore. Stanley! What's going on in there?

Stanley: You have a toilet, oh cool! Is that what I think it is? (SpongeBob opens the door. an explosion happens.)

SpongeBob: Well, it was bath night.

Stanley: TV... Uncle Sherm never let me watch TV at home.

SpongeBob: Why not? (an explosion happens)

Stanley: Oh, that's why. What's that?

SpongeBob: Oh, it's okay. There's nothing good on TV anyway. Nothing...

Stanley: (looking at a picture of SpongeBob in front of the Krusty Krab) You work at the Krusty Krab?

SpongeBob: Yes! I'm best at doing those things. (looking at pictures) That's me opening the front door key! That's me sending orders! And that's me peforming sanitary maintenance!

Stanley: And what's that?

SpongeBob: That's me making Krabby Patties! Best job in the world. I call it.

Stanley: I wish I had a job.

SpongeBob: Oh, it's okay, Stanley. There's nothing perfect in life. You're good.

Stanley: You really think so?

SpongeBob: I think so. I think you should see my friend Squidward, though. (outside) Hi, Squidward. I'd like you to meet my cousin Stanley:

Stanley: We're related. (Squidward runs out of the house with all his things. He puts a "for sale" sign next to it. A truck reading "Bikini Bottom Movers" comes up. Squidward places his things inside and gets in it

Squidward: Step on it!

Stanley: Your friend Squidward is busy.

SpongeBob: Oh, it's ok. I'm sure my friend Sandy can think of something. (at the treedome)

Sandy: Hey, SpongeBob. Who's your friend?

SpongeBob: This is my cousin, Stanley. I think you can tell him how to be a scientist.

Sandy: Sure. Glad to meet you, Stanley.

Stanley: Nice to meet you too, Sa...(Stanley trips on a rock) Whoa! (his buck teeth rip a hole in Sandy's air suit)

Sandy: (floating up to the surface) Oh, boy. Stanley!

SpongeBob: I think she's just not scientist material. But don't you worry. I bet Patrick can help you! He's a genius! (at Patrick's house) And so, Mr. Star, that's why we came to you.

Patrick: Looking for your call, huh? (examines Stanley) What are you good at?

Stanley: Nothing.

Patrick: Nothing at all?

Stanley: Yep.

Patrick: Interesting. Let's see how good you are. Nothing.

SpongeBob: That's perfect! You can do nothing better than anybody! All because you're the master!

Patrick: Come with me. First, sit down on this chair. Hear it. Empty your whole thoughts. Clear your mind. Nothing.

Stanley: I must clear my mind. Nothing. (Stanley is nervous. he hears Patrick's clock ticking and sees Patrick making a weird face) Nothing. No!

Patrick: So you're not following my instruction to be immobile, huh? Leave, my brethren.

Stanley: Can I try?

Patrick: Leave!

Stanley: I can do nothing right.

SpongeBob: Don't worry! We just have to keep on looking! (looks at his watch and takes out his Krusty Krab hat) Oh, gentle hat, symbol of employment! Stone of my eternal happiness! (kisses it and puts it on) Wooo! You have no idea how this feels.

Stanley: No! (starts to cry)

SpongeBob: Hey, what's wrong, Stanley? You're not still upset about that whole never accomplished anything in your life thing, are you? Good, then why don't you come with me to work. Everything you need is to see what it's like!

Mr. Krabs: Hello, my litle money maker. Are you gonna make me lots of money today?

SpongeBob: Yes!

Mr. Krabs: Ah, if only there are two of you...what?

SpongeBob: This is my cousin Stanley! He'd like a job.

Mr. Krabs: The other one. He feels like you. He smells like you. He tastes like you! Hmm...yes! You've got the job! (starts his job. he touches the register) Money. Burning? SpongeBob! Are you responsible for this?

SpongeBob: I guess I am. (at the kitchen) If you wanna keep this job, you have to work! Woo! I have to take that out. For duty!

Stanley: Hey, our first customer. Hi, I'm Stanley!

Harold: Hmm...I'd like a...

Stanley: A picture coming up! I don't want to forget this moment. Let's take a part! (after many pictures, the customer cannot take it anymore. he explodes) Wait till I get this developed. (the line complains)

SpongeBob: I hear something! Aah! (the customers start a riot. Mr. Krabs goes in the kitchen)

Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What's the meaning of this? Your workplace looks horrible. Try to get to work, boy! Why don't you act like Stanley, boy? Caring about the customers! (Mr. Krabs looks at a wedding-themed picture of Stanley and Harold)

SpongeBob: Um...sir?

Mr. Krabs: Yes, boy?

SpongeBob: About the new one?

Mr. Krabs: Yes, yes. The one I hired on your recommendation.

SpongeBob: About what I said...

Mr. Krabs: What, boy? You didn't lie to me about taking your cousin on the job, didn't you?

SpongeBob: No.

Mr. Krabs: Well, good. Because there are plenty of other cousins I didn't pass applying for a job.

Sandy's Cousin: (scottish)

Squidward's Cousin: Whatever.

Mr. Krabs: I even turned down my three adorable nephews. It's not great. Now go think about why you didn't get the job!

SpongeBob: Stanley, I cannot keep covering for you! (sees that Stanley has bent Spat) No! Not my spatula! My spatula...I had this for years in my heart.

Mr. Krabs: What in the name of neptune is going on? Oh. You broke your spatula. That's cheap. I don't even do it, boy.

SpongeBob: No! No! No! I didn't break my spatula. He did! I also didn't break the money. He did, too! I hed to keep on covering for him because he can't do anything right!

Stanley: He's right! I destroy everything I touch! (runs off crying)

Mr. Krabs: Wait a minute...I know the perfect job for you!

SpongeBob: Good luck on your new job, Stanley!

Stanley: Oh, I bet I'll do even better at this one!

Plankton: Good morning, Stanley!

Stanley: Good morning, boss!

Plankton: That fool Krabs letting the relative of his passed worker...(the Chum Bucket explodes as Mr. Krabs watches through the window) Well, it came to be.

Stanley: Sorry, boss.
